                <p>In our research on securities class action lawsuits, we measure the impact the lawsuits by looking at abnormal returns over the 30-day period following a securities lawsuit. We calculate the abnormal returns by comparing how the company performed with how the S&amp;P 500 performed on average over the same 30-day period.</p>

<p>For example, if the S&amp;P 500 rose 10% in the 30-days following a lawsuit against company X, and the company X’s stock remained at the same price during that period, then we calculate an abnormal return of -10% for company X.</p>

<p>Here is a histogram for all the abnormal returns for all securities class actions from 2011-2020.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/SCA%20Histogram.png" alt="SCA Histogram.png" /></p>

<p>There are a few things to note about this chart. Firstly, about one third of the time the company’s share value increases after a securities lawsuit is filed. Most people would consider getting named as a defendant in a lawsuit as bad news, so the most likely explanation for the modest increase we see in a about a third of cases comes from positive developments that cancel out the bad news.</p>

<p>Secondly, about a third of the time the lawsuit coincides with a relatively modest underperformance by the company, with abnormal returns of zero to -10%. This is partially due to the fact that the impact of securities class actions on large companies tends to be significantly less than their impact on small companies:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/SCA%20impact%20by%20size.png" alt="SCA impact by size.png" /></p>

<p>Large cap companies have access to more resources that can help them mitigate the impact of a securities class action suit. Large companies can afford a PR firm and can take steps to change the media narrative. Additionally, investors may think that the lawsuit is immaterial if the company is large and wealthy enough.</p>

<p>The final thing to note about the table is that it is skewed to the left. About a third of the time the company named as a defendant will have abnormal returns that are worse than -10%. In comparison, fewer than one-tenth of companies had positive returns that were better than 10%.</p>

<p>The data indicates that securities lawsuits pose a significant risk of intense losses for any given company.</p>
