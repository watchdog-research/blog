                <p>Securities Class Action suits tend to have a negative effect on companies of all sizes. But Small and Mid cap companies tend to suffer more when named as a defendant.</p>

<p>In our last <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-post-cyan-paradigm/">post</a> we measured the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision in Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employee Retirement Fund (<em>Cyan</em>). It increased the rates of Securities Class Action lawsuits for all companies but had a larger effect on litigation for Small and Mid cap companies than for Large companies.</p>

<p><em>This blog is derived from “Frequency and Impact of Securities Class Actions” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email <a href="mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com">jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>Our team measures the impact of Securities Class Actions suits on public companies by looking at returns over the thirty-day period following a lawsuit and comparing those returns to the S&amp;P 500 for the same period of time.</p>

<p>We looked at the abnormal returns of for every company following a Securities Class Action lawsuit for the past ten years and segmented the results by size.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Table%20SCA%20Effect%20by%20Size.png" alt="Table SCA Effect by Size.png" /></p>

<p>Statistically, the negative impact of a Securities Class Action lawsuit was inversely proportional to a company’s size. The impact on Small cap companies was more than five times worse than the impact on Large cap companies.</p>

<p>These statistics bring the impact of <em>Cyan</em> into clearer focus. It appears that by opening state courts to Securities Class Action suits, the Supreme Court’s decision has created a significant burden on Small to Mid cap companies.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s decision has dramatically increased the rate of litigation for Small cap companies, a group which traditionally suffers the most when involved in this sort of litigation.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Small cap and Mid cap companies have limited resources, and this post-<em>Cyan</em> paradigm has put an unwelcome strain on these limited resources.</p>

<p>Even Small cap companies that have not been subject to Securities Class Action suits have suffered, as the D&amp;O insurance market has hardened in response to these trends since getting named in a suit is not a matter of <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>.</p>

<p>Higher insurance premiums are passed on to investors, employees, and customers, harming everyone. The question is, is the post-<em>Cyan</em> paradigm here to stay?</p>
