&lt;p&gt;A SPAC, also known as blank-check company, is a stock created by sponsors that raises money in an initial public offering with no underlying business. Investors entrust their money to one of these sponsors, instead of to an operating company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/five-key-takeaways-from-the-sec-s-3931115/&quot;&gt;Typically&lt;/a&gt;, the SPAC must use its cash within two years to buy a private company (in a de-SPAC transaction), or refund the money to investors. Generally, investors don’t know what the acquisition target will be until the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New but not necessarily improved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors always intend to make money. Unfortunately, the track record for profitability among SPACs is not stellar. Most of the larger SPACs formed since 2020 that were still trading as of April 30, 2021, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/tech-and-spacs-sec-regulation-could-result-in-fewer-but-better-spacs-64000801&quot;&gt;declined in value&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly 200 of these stocks dropped between 0% and 2% compared to their IPO prices; over half of those did worse. Overall, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/71816/Updated-SPAC-returns-fall-short-of-traditional-IPO-returns-on-average#:\~:text=Of%20the%20313%20SPACs%20IPOs,for%20traditional%20IPOs%20since%202015.&quot;&gt;mean return&lt;/a&gt; of SPACs since 2015 was -9.6%; the median return was -29.1%. Only 31.1% had positive returns. Traditional IPOs had returns of &lt;strong&gt;47%&lt;/strong&gt; over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding the roller coaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors may be fooled by short-term performance of SPACs. In the first phase of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indexologyblog.com/2021/04/15/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-spacs-part-iv/&quot;&gt;life cycle&lt;/a&gt;, post-IPO, i.e., the initiation of the SPAC, SPACs somewhat underperformed the S&amp;amp;P SmallCap 600 Index. However, on announcement of a target for acquisition, the stocks temporarily soar, and some of the stocks continue to do well for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only 30 days later, most are back to underperforming the S&amp;amp;P SmallCap 600. After the de-SPAC deal is completed, the stocks tend to decline, and investment returns get worse over time after the merger deal, with mean down 17.6% and median down 28.8% a year later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down when the market is up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPACCNBC&quot;&gt;CNBC SPAC 50 Index&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks the 50 largest U.S.-based pre-merger blank-check deals by market cap, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/a-spac-frenzy-this-year-could-lead-to-riskier-deals-heres-why.html&quot;&gt;slumped&lt;/a&gt; nearly 4% year to date, erasing all 2021 gains, at a time when the Nasdaq has gained 6%. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPACDEAL&quot;&gt;CNBC SPAC Post Deal Index&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the largest SPACs that have come to market and have announced a target, is down about 15% year to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech SPACs that have closed a deal have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/tech-and-spacs-too-much-of-two-good-things-63177042&quot;&gt;underperformed&lt;/a&gt;. Financial firms and industrials have done better. Automotive companies have done particularly well, though that is possibly due to speculative investment in driverless or “green” technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPACs may seem to be a good alternative to traditional IPOs for small-time retail investors, because of the relatively low cost to own shares. However, over the last 18 months, the average investment returns for SPACs have been far inferior to those for traditional IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>elise_rose</name></author><category term="SPACs" /><category term="featured" /><category term="SPACs" /><category term="Returns" /><summary type="html">The investment returns for most SPACs are not as good as those for traditional IPOs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Burning%20Money.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Burning%20Money.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Matchmaker, Matchmaker–Sponsor Advantage</title><link href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/matchmaker-matchmaker-sponsor-advantage/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matchmaker, Matchmaker–Sponsor Advantage" /><published>2021-07-07T15:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-07-07T15:38:00-04:00</updated><id>https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/matchmaker-matchmaker-sponsor-advantage</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/matchmaker-matchmaker-sponsor-advantage/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The structure of SPACs leads to an inherent advantage for sponsors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SPAC, also known as blank-check company, is a stock created by sponsors that raises money in an initial public offering with no underlying business. Investors entrust their money to one of these sponsors, instead of to an operating company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/five-key-takeaways-from-the-sec-s-3931115/&quot;&gt;Typically&lt;/a&gt;, the SPAC must use its cash within two years to buy a private company (in a de-SPAC transaction), or refund the money to investors. Generally, investors don’t know what the acquisition target will be until the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware the unknown “spouse”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could think of the sponsors of a SPAC as matchmakers. The retail investor puts money in based on the reputation of the matchmaker, who may have brought about brilliant financial “marriages” in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the investor has little to go on but trust in the promises of the matchmaker. The matchmaker is obliged to find a “spouse” (merger target), but it could be an indifferent or even a poor match for the investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matchmaker is guaranteed to make money, and in some cases has undisclosed or even blatant conflicts of interests in the proposed match. The retail investor may end up with no money, no dowry, and an unhappy marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPAC sponsors usually buy into a SPAC at more favorable terms than retail investors in the IPO or subsequent investors on the open market. Often a sponsor obtains 20% of the shares in a SPAC for either nothing or a nominal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/what-you&quot;&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya, the “King of SPACs”, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-27/spacs-can-take-away-the-insiders-advantage-in-ipos-and-markets&quot;&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; for regulation of the trendy vehicles, recommends that the government require sponsors to commit personal capital to the SPAC. Palihapitiya notes that only 48 of the 127 SPACs that have announced, but not yet closed on, a deal had some form of sponsor investment, with only 10 making long-term commitments to the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrities or &lt;a href=&quot;ttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-13/spac-king-chamath-palihapitiya-hopes-his-hype-will-keep-mesmerizing-you&quot;&gt;big-name investors&lt;/a&gt; receive far more value than they pay for. Often the retail investor has little information other than the reputation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkadvisor.tradepub.com/free/w_johc18/&quot;&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt;. “You might think of investing in a new SPAC as being more interested in the jockey than the horse.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/AOq-oPqQBBI/chamath-palihapitiya&quot;&gt;Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; advises examining the amount the sponsor is investing to assess the legitimacy of a SPAC. Although most of the SPAC’s capital has been provided by IPO investors, the sponsors will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-special-purpose-acquisition-companies&quot;&gt;benefit&lt;/a&gt; more than other investors from the SPAC’s completion of an initial business combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Chamath &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/AOq-oPqQBBI/chamath-palihapitiya&quot;&gt;Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; himself exemplifies sponsor advantage. He received 20,500,000 “founders shares” of the SPAC IPOC, worth $205 million in stock, for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/&quot;&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt; of $25,000 from his firm Social Capital Hedosophia, and for promoting the SPAC and its target Clover. He also bought $100 million worth of shares at the regular price, so he obtained 30.5 million shares for the price of slightly over 10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilution is not the solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkadvisor.tradepub.com/free/w_johc18/&quot;&gt;dilution&lt;/a&gt;. Many investors sell their shares when the merger is announced, which is usually the highest point of value in the SPAC life cycle. This drains the cash that could help the soon-to-be-acquired company. The sponsors, who initially put down almost nothing, are still in the deal. Retail SPAC investors who stay with the deal hold shares backed by substantially less cash than at their initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator John Kennedy (R-La.), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2021/4/kennedy-introduces-spac-act-to-increase-transparency-surrounding-blank-check-companies&quot;&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; to ensure investors have adequate transparency into SPAC deals, particularly when it comes to what are called “founder’s shares,” a special class of shares that go to the SPAC sponsors after the merger is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfodive.com/news/as-sec-ramps-up-spac-rules-lawsuits-could-follow/599906/&quot;&gt;Kennedy said&lt;/a&gt; when introducing the bill, “When SPAC sponsors convert the shares that they receive in the merged company, the public’s shares of that company are diluted and lose value. The valuation of SPAC shares may fall even further if a SPAC sponsor chooses a weak company with which to merge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under pressure, overvalued&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the deadline for a merger approaches, sponsors may have an incentive to complete a transaction on terms where they make money but the retail investor does not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/08-54#:\~:text=A%20SPAC%20typically%20must%20complete,of%20the%20assets%20in%20escrow.&quot;&gt;FINRA&lt;/a&gt; warned investors of this as far back as 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPAC managers have a strong incentive to buy a company, even at inflated values, since they will get 20 percent of the company at a nominal price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a deal doesn’t go through, the firms that create SPACs must return the money initial investors paid in. The sponsors definitely want to avoid this scenario. So there’s a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-spacs-part-ii&quot;&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt; for SPAC sponsors to find a target company for merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company targeted for acquisition must comprise over 80% of the trust account assets. This creates an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-spacs-part-ii&quot;&gt;incentive&lt;/a&gt; for the SPAC’s sponsors to overvalue a target company to get the deal done. If sponsors have relatively little “skin in the game”, they are not harmed, but retail investors don’t get their money’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Beware the matchmaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail investors who provide the bulk of the funds for SPACs have to weather the ups and downs of the market. Sponsors are not usually required to put very much, if any, of their own money into their SPACs. Therefore, they are guaranteed to make a profit when the merger happens, regardless of how the SPAC performs. Sponsors also have perverse incentives to target weaker companies for acquisition to avoid refunding money if the de-SPAC transaction doesn’t go through. Investors are cautioned to examine the matchmaker with care, because in most cases, they won’t find a matchless match.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>elise_rose</name></author><category term="SPACs" /><category term="featured" /><category term="SPACs" /><category term="Conflict of Interest" /><summary type="html">The structure of SPACs leads to an inherent advantage for sponsors.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Couple.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Couple.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sizzle and PIPE Dreams in SPAC-land</title><link href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/sizzle-and-pipe-dreams-in-spac-land/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sizzle and PIPE Dreams in SPAC-land" /><published>2021-06-28T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-28T10:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/sizzle-and-pipe-dreams-in-spac-land</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/sizzle-and-pipe-dreams-in-spac-land/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACs are allowed to make dazzling projections without supporting data and retail investors may not be aware of some conflicts of interest that influence sponsors’ investment behavior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/27/sec-considers-new-investor-protections-for-spacs.html&quot;&gt;exploded&lt;/a&gt; in popularity in the last 18 months, with 90% created in 2020 or 2021. A SPAC, also known as blank-check company, is a stock created by sponsors that raises money in an initial public offering with no underlying business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/five-key-takeaways-from-the-sec-s-3931115/&quot;&gt;Typically&lt;/a&gt;, the SPAC must use its cash within two years to buy a private company (in a de-SPAC transaction), or refund the money to investors. Generally, investors don’t know what the acquisition target will be until the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPAC usually uses additional funds from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/26/spac-investing-101-what-is-a-pipe-and-what-should/&quot;&gt;PIPE&lt;/a&gt; (private investment in public equity) to accomplish the de-SPAC. By starting the company this way, a SPAC purports to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkadvisor.tradepub.com/free/w_johc18/&quot;&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt; the regulatory requirements of a traditional IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of SPACs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/spacs-an-attractive-alternative-to-a-8460350/&quot;&gt;tout&lt;/a&gt; them as good for small-time retail investors, because of the relatively low cost to own shares (usually only $10) and the ability to divest of shares before the merger. However, there are a number of notable risks for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sizzle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPACs have a looser regulatory environment than traditional IPOs. They can make projections that traditionally are “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/spacs-ipos-liability-risk-under-securities-laws&quot;&gt;not commonly found in conventional IPO prospectuses&lt;/a&gt;.” This allows the sponsors, those who start the SPAC, to “sell the sizzle, not the steak”, because until the merger is announced, there is, in fact, no steak to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors have little information to go on in assessing the SPAC. In particular, retail investors may not be aware of conflicts of interest that influence sponsors’ investment behavior. The SEC admitted as much when it provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-special-purpose-acquisition-companies&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; for SPAC disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The economic interests of the entity or management team&lt;/em&gt; … &lt;em&gt;often differ from the economic interests of public shareholders which may lead to conflicts of interests&lt;/em&gt; as they evaluate and decide whether to recommend business combination transactions to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this guidance, SPAC sponsors have &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to target companies where they have apparently have a personal vested interest. SPAC are not prohibited from these self-interested transactions. They only have to tell investors, usually in a lengthy disclosure, that the SPAC capital might be used to buy one of their own companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent story &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/&quot;&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; in TechCrunch looked at the example of Reid Hoffman, a SPAC sponsor who is close to finalizing a merger deal with autonomous vehicle startup Aurora. But Hoffman’s venture firm, Greylock, began investing in Aurora in 2018, and he is on its board of directors. He could set the price for acquisition of Aurora by his SPAC at a level that would greatly enhance its value and therefore his bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPAC proponent Chamath Palihapitiya, the “King of SPACs”, invested in insurance company Clover through his firm Social Capital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-13/spac-king-chamath-palihapitiya-hopes-his-hype-will-keep-mesmerizing-you&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; one of his SPACs merged with Clover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clover-health-m-a-social-capital/clover-health-to-go-public-via-3-7-billion-deal-with-social-capital-idUSKBN26R1XB&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/06/07/spac-king-regains-billionaire-status-as-trading-frenzy-boosts-clover-health/?sh=3990179f3828&quot;&gt;Since the merger&lt;/a&gt;, Clover has been the subject of an SEC investigation, an undisclosed Justice Department inquiry, and an accusation by short-seller Hindenburg Research of fraud, including kickbacks, misrepresentation and undisclosed third-party deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stops these ethically questionable investments because the SEC’s guidelines are suggestions, not law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banks that sponsor SPACs also have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/tech-and-spacs-sec-regulation-could-result-in-fewer-but-better-spacs-64000801&quot;&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; conflict of interest. Some banking sponsors invest minimal amounts into a SPAC, but then also underwrite the launch of the IPO and serve as advisors for the deal to acquire an operating company. Often those fees are much larger than the bank’s investment as a sponsor, so the bank might have a much greater financial interest in completion of the merger deal than in the success of the SPAC itself. In March the SEC opened an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-us-regulator-opens-inquiry-into-wall-streets-blank-check-ipo-frenzy-2021-03-25/&quot;&gt;inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into Wall Street banks, seeking information on how underwriters are managing the risks involved in their SPACs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC may be looking into the depth of due diligence SPACs perform before acquiring assets in the de-SPAC transaction, and whether huge payouts are fully disclosed to investors. The regulators may also be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-us-regulator-opens-inquiry-into-wall-streets-blank-check-ipo-frenzy-2021-03-25/&quot;&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; about the heightened risk of insider trading between the initiation of the SPAC and when it announces its acquisition target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail investors should be aware that SPAC sponsors who have a vested interest in the target company may be using the merger to shore up a failing venture, a risky investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIPE Dreams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail investors also fare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/26/spac-investing-101-what-is-a-pipe-and-what-should/&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; than the PIPE investors, who come in just before or after the merger is announced. The PIPE investors come in after they know the target, but still get to buy shares for $10, though they are often worth $15 or $20 right away. Ordinary investors can’t buy at the lower price this late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waking From the Dream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison Herren Lee, the SEC’s current acting chair, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfodive.com/news/ipo-deregulation-Allison-Herren-Lee-Jay-Clayton/586858/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last October at the Practicing Law Institute’s SEC Speaks, “In the short term, a SPAC investment acts largely as a blank check, so it is critical that [there’s an understanding of] the material risks involved.” As Paul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/munter-spac-20200331&quot;&gt;Munter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC,&lt;/em&gt; noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a company enters the public markets through a merger with a SPAC, traditional IPO, or other process, the quality and reliability of financial reporting and the quality of audits on the financial statements provided to investors is vital to our efforts to protect investors and to the confidence of investors in our markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months the SEC has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/five-key-takeaways-from-the-sec-s-3931115/&quot;&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; that SPACs will be subject to increased levels of scrutiny. One key area of focus has been on the disclosure of germane conflicts of interest from each SPAC participant: insiders like the sponsors and management team; the IPO’s public shareholders; and third parties like underwriters. These parties will need to avoid conflicts or scrupulously disclose them if they wish to avoid enforcement actions and liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajiv Shukla, chairman and CEO of SPAC Alpha Healthcare Acquisition Corp., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/tech-and-spacs-sec-regulation-could-result-in-fewer-but-better-spacs-64000801&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; the SEC will also likely require enhanced disclosures on other financial interests of sponsors over the lifecycle of the SPAC deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail investors who are interested in investing in a SPAC should do as much due diligence on the sponsors of the SPAC as they reasonably can. After all, since there is no underlying company, you really are just investing in the sponsors. If in the past, the sponsors have used SPAC funds to invest in target companies with financial ties to those sponsors, you may want to reconsider giving them your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our firm, Watchdog Research, uses statistical analysis of past events to evaluate a company’s future. One of the most important events we track is the occurrence of Securities Class Action (SCA) lawsuits. All the data presented in this article is based on our statistical analysis of publicly available data concerning public companies on the NYSE and NASDAQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our database allows us to track the probability that any given companies will be named in a SCA suit for a given year. Overall, the probability in the last ten years has increased, which has contributed to a hard market for D&amp;amp;O insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Picture1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Segmenting by Size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our database shows us that this risk is not uniform for companies of all sizes. The larger a company is, the more likely it is to be named in a SCA suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Picture2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our research companies with over $10 billion in market capitalization are categorized as Large cap. Companies with less than $1 billion are categorized as Small cap. And all the companies that fall between them are considered Mid cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyan&lt;/em&gt; brought about a significant shift in the legal landscape for SCAs. So it is possible that higher SCA rates are part of a new paradigm and that there will be no return to mean. If that is the case, then the averages seen between 2017-2020 may become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Table%20SCA%20by%20Market%20Cap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table SCA by Market Cap.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of a company may be one the most important factors to know concerning a company’s likelihood of being named in a SCA. It holds true in every industry, even in pharmaceuticals where small companies are particularly volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20by%20Size%20and%20Industry.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA by Size and Industry.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large companies are far more likely to be named in a SCA than small companies, but larger companies often have the resources to handle these suits. We looked at the abnormal returns for all companies after they were named in a SCA suit and found that these events had a far greater negative impact on smaller companies than larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20impact%20by%20size-278a03.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA impact by size-278a03.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We calculated these abnormal returns by comparing the company’s stock price performance to the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the 30 days following the announcement of a SCA suit. It is clear that after the initial shock of the announcement wears off, large companies tend to recover quickly. Smaller companies tend not to fare as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data shows that no matter the industry, the larger a company is, the more likely it is to get sued in a SCA. However the risk calculation is not simple. Smaller firms are far less likely to get sued, but far more likely to suffer dramatic losses as a result of that suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian firm 3G Capital collaborated to facilitate a merger that formed Kraft Heinz (KHC). In 2019 Kraft Heinz issued one of the largest impairments in history, over $15 billion. This impairment seems to have been a direct consequence of corporate governance &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-complaint-alleges-fundamental-corporate-governance-problems-accounting-shenanigans-and-insider-trading/&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; arising out of the merger. And it did not end there, Kraft Heinz impaired an additional $5 billion over the next two years and has been engaged in protracted legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every merger presents a difficult challenge of reconciling two different systems (each company has its own corporate culture, governance philosophy, financial reporting methods, IT solutions, compensation practices, etc.). When this reconciliation process does not go well, it can create serious problems that can play out over a course of years. This has been the story for Kraft Heinz, but they are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlating Mergers and Securities Class Action (SCA) Lawsuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research into mergers indicates that a company takes a big risk when it merges with another company that is relatively comparable in size. In contrast, a company takes significantly less risk if it gobbles up a relatively small operation. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/paypal-obscuring-problems-from-new-acquisitions/&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; wrote off almost all of the $230 million it spent acquiring TIO in 2017 without batting an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When cataloging these mergers for our research, relatively large mergers are assigned a red flag and relatively small mergers are assigned a yellow flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research indicates that over the last 20 years companies with a red-flag merger were &lt;strong&gt;2.12&lt;/strong&gt; times as likely to be named in a SCA lawsuit in the same calendar year (potentially occurring before or after the merger). Companies with a yellow-flag merger were &lt;strong&gt;1.38&lt;/strong&gt; times as likely to be subject to suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not as dramatic as it sounds. It is likely that in many cases these lawsuits &lt;em&gt;preceded&lt;/em&gt; the merger as merger-objection suits. Merger objection lawsuits typically lack substance and are often dealt with quickly. These ubiquitous lawsuits artificially inflate the number of lawsuits included in the calculation and diminish the importance of the relatively high correlation we found in the same calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we were surprised to see that when we looked at the correlation between red-flag mergers and SCA suits there was a slightly stronger signal in the &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20Merger%20Leading%20Indicator.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA Merger Leading Indicator.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, any company that had a merger was &lt;strong&gt;1.45&lt;/strong&gt; times as likely to be subject to a SCA suit as a company that had not engaged in a merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for companies that had red-flag mergers, they were &lt;strong&gt;2.14&lt;/strong&gt; times as likely to be subject to a SCA the following year. Even without the inflationary effect of the merger objection suits, these red-flag mergers were a very strong leading indicator for SCA suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most actors in the market think on a quarterly basis, but insurance and investment professionals need to think in longer terms. Mergers are often forgotten by the markets almost as soon as they are consummated, but the problems that they create can linger for months, or even years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By law, every public company must hire an independent auditor to review their financial statements and offer an opinion. Although the public is privy to an auditor’s final opinion, almost all the auditor’s work is shrouded in mystery. However, every company must disclose how much money it spends on audit related services (audit fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies negotiate with their auditors every year over price, so year-over-year and peer-to-peer comparisons of fees can potentially reveal interesting insights about what is going on behind the scenes at a company. For this reason, there have been a number of academic papers on audit fees and their potential implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time evidence has emerged that audit fees are “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MAJ-08-2013-0915/full/html&quot;&gt;sticky&lt;/a&gt;” and do not adjust rapidly to changing conditions at a company. This makes sense considering the multifaceted relationship that develops between an auditor and management. Yes, auditors are independent, but they want to serve their clients and maintain a strong relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes an auditor’s fee will buck this trend and jump…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon was the subject of a 2016 academic paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2826272&quot;&gt;Abnormal Audit Fees and Accounting Quality&lt;/a&gt;.” The authors found evidence that companies whose audit fees jumped up out of their normal range had indicators of lower accounting quality (e.g., a greater risk for restatements, material weaknesses, and fraud). The authors hypothesized that sharp increases in fees were due to efforts by auditors to fix problems, indicating the &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of problems in financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unexplained jump in audit fees is certainly a red flag (we have also discussed that same point with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/do-not-ignore-spikes-in-non-audit-fees/&quot;&gt;non-audit fees&lt;/a&gt;). But insurance and investment professionals should be cautious even when a ready explanation for the increase in fees is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Complicated Real-World Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, TCF Financial Corporation’s annual report disclosed a sharp jump in their audit fees. This increase coincided with a reverse merger with Chemical Bank that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/19612/000001961219000179/a8-kmergerannouncmentc.htm&quot;&gt;consummated&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, but the increase in audit fees may also have represented remediation efforts by the auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Audit%20Fees%20TCF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Audit Fees TCF.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible signal of trouble came from the non-audit fees, which also reported a spike in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, Probes Reporter confirmed that TCF Financial was subject to an undisclosed investigation by the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/TCF%20SEC%20Investigation.png&quot; alt=&quot;TCF SEC Investigation.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2020, Craig Dahl left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/19612/000001961220000190/a8k2020.htm&quot;&gt;abruptly&lt;/a&gt; as CEO after serving in the position of the joint company after a little over a year (he had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.tcfbank.com/news/news-details/2020/TCF-Financial-Corp.-CEO-Craig-R.-Dahl-to-Retire/default.aspx&quot;&gt;tenured&lt;/a&gt; at TCF for 21 years and had served as their CEO prior to the merger).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A company spokesperson took issue with an earlier version of this story where we characterized Mr. Dahl’s departure as a removal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why he was departed from his position early, but his resignation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/19612/000001961220000190/a8k2020.htm&quot;&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; the day after the announcement. For some context, the TCF’s CFO’s resignation also became effective in October, but his departure was announced in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19612/000001961220000190/exhibit101dahlseparati.htm&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to pay the former CEO a significant lump sum, over $11 million, and $1.5 million a month for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is possible that TCF’s sharp increases in audit fees and non-audit fees had nothing to do with the SEC investigation, or whatever lead to the abrupt departure of the CEO, but the academic literature indicates that jumps in audit fees are a sign of trouble in the financial statements and should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic research of audit fees indicates that they are “sticky,” so sharp increases can be considered an abnormal event.  Insurance and investment professionals should do their best to carefully discern when these abnormal increases are a sign of potential trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every publicly traded company must disclose how much money they pay their independent auditor, and thanks to Sarbanes Oxley, they must disclose how much money was for audit services (audit fees) and how much was for services unrelated to the audit (non-audit fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent audit firms have expertise in a wide range of services, so it is not unusual for a company to hire their auditor for services unrelated to their audit. In fact, despite the independence concern it can create, our research shows that companies with higher non-audit fees are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/auditors-can-help-prevent-costly-litigation/&quot;&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to be subject to securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a spike in non-audit fees can be a cause for concern. A dramatic increase in non-audit fees does not necessarily indicate a negative event, but it does indicate that something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; is occurring and that it requires the expertise of an accounting firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spikes in Non-Audit Fees Can Foreshadow Negative Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Under Armour reported a dramatic spike in non-audit fees. In November 2019, the Wall Street Journal broke a story that Under Armour was subject to an SEC investigation concerning their accounting practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that Under Armour’s increase in non-audit fees were related to navigating the investigation and remediating the problems that led to the SEC investigation. The SEC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-78&quot;&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; the case for $9 million less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spikes in Non-Audit Fees Can Merely Accompany Complicated Financial Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spike in non-audit fees signals a new event, but not necessarily one that is negative. For example, in 2016 Hilton Hotels paid non-audit fees of over $13 million, a &lt;strong&gt;181%&lt;/strong&gt; increase over the prior year. This increase was primarily due the complicated tax implications for Hilton’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/hilton-completes-split-into-three-independent-companies/2017/01/06/04414772-d287-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html&quot;&gt;spinoff&lt;/a&gt; into three distinct entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Example of Motorola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola is a casualty of the iPhone. From dominance to relative obscurity, the company has all but faded from memory (although it remains a relatively large company with $33 billion in market capitalization).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Motorola had the largest percentage increase in non-audit fees of any company over the last five years, rising &lt;strong&gt;2,200%&lt;/strong&gt; from $100,000 to $2.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Motorola%20non-audit%20fees.png&quot; alt=&quot;Motorola non-audit fees.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increase was probably due in part to Motorola’s auditor change, from KPMG (which had served as their auditor for over 50 years) to PricewaterhouseCoopers. It is also interesting that Motorola’s CFO departed in June, 2020, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/68505/000119312520184064/d939178d8k.htm&quot;&gt;personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;not claiming&lt;/em&gt; that Motorola has done something wrong. But unexplained change carries risk, and our job at Watchdog is to help investment and insurance professionals spot risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We contacted Motorola for comment and they simply replied that non-audit fees for 2021 were disclosed on page 76 of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/68505/000119312521103275/d25774ddef14a.htm&quot;&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disclosure of audit and non-audit fees gives some limited insight into a company. If the fees are changing, it must be because something at the company is changing. Although oftentimes the explanation is readily available to investors, sometimes it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is important to know what you do not know. For D&amp;amp;O insurance professionals, it is important to spot these potential risks and get explanations from the company when underwriting a policy or renewing a contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Audit Fees and Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur Anderson was famously paid more by Enron for consultancy work than for audit work. Arthur Anderson’s loss of independence, along with allegations that they had participated in Enron’s fraud, destroyed the largest accounting firm in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation currently requires that every public company disclose how much money it pays its auditor. Companies must also distinguish between money paid for the legally required audit (audit fees), and money paid for other services (non-audit fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators like the SEC and the FRC are concerned with the effect that non-audit work can have on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.auditanalytics.com/changes-to-auditor-independence-regulations-us-vs-uk/&quot;&gt;auditor independence&lt;/a&gt;. Different regulators have different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifac.org/system/files/meetings/files/2901.pdf&quot;&gt;thresholds&lt;/a&gt; for deciding when non-audit work potentially raises a red flag for independence issues, ranging from 10-30% of the total fee. Despite the widespread agreement by regulators that non-audit fees create independence issues, the academic literature is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Watchdog Research we follow the lead of major regulators and assign a yellow flag whenever non-audit fees exceed 30% of the total fee paid to the independent auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Audit Fees are Negatively Correlated with Securities Class Action Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the Audit Analytics database, which has over 20 years of data, to examine the relationship between non-audit fees and securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that the presence of a yellow flag for non-audit fees in a given year is &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; correlated with securities class action lawsuits for that year. Companies with a yellow flag for non-audit fees were &lt;strong&gt;12% less likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more surprising, this negative correlation persists for the &lt;em&gt;following year&lt;/em&gt;. Companies assigned a yellow flag for non-audit fees in a given year were &lt;strong&gt;7% less likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be named a defendant in a securities class action in the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every public company has complex tax and accounting issues, but companies vary widely in how many resources they allocate to address these issues. It is possible that non-audit fees are negatively associated with litigation because these companies are dedicating more resources to resolving complex accounting and tax issues instead of letting them fester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment and insurance professionals should carefully consider the overall resources the company allocates to addressing complex accounting and tax issues, including non-audit fees. Too little investment increases the risk of costly mistakes, which can lead to costly litigation. For D&amp;amp;O underwriters, the level of non-audit fees could be a helpful factor to consider when setting a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFOs play a crucial role at every public company. They are the ones primarily responsible for ensuring that the financial reporting is accurate and complete. It is important for the CFO to be diligent, highly competent, and confident enough to fix problems when other members of management would rather have them swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research consistently identifies red-flag CFO changes as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;leading indicator&lt;/a&gt; of securities class action suits. This would indicate that an unusual CFO departure has a ripple effect that can create short-term and long-term problems at a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years &lt;strong&gt;13.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies replaced their CFO in any given year. However, some industries had significantly higher turnover rates. Here are the five industries (classified by NAICS code) that had the worst turnover rates for the CFO position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Pharmaceuticals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceuticals are well known for their volatility and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/impact-of-cyan-comparing-the-market-today-to-the-pharmaceuticals-of-yesteryear/&quot;&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; named in securities class action suits. Pharmaceuticals had an annual turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;15.1%&lt;/strong&gt;. The only surprising thing about their appearance on this list is that they aren’t higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Wholesale Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are companies that sell merchandise, energy, or even food to wholesalers. Their CFOs had an annual turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;15.2%&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the biggest companies in that industry Sysco (SYY), a food distributor, had red-flag departures for both their CEO and CFO in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes companies like Facebook, S&amp;amp;P Global, and Accenture. The CFOs in this industry had a turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;16.5%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Entertainment, Recreation, and Other Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes companies like Disney, DraftKings, and Planet Fitness. The CFOs in this industry had a turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;17.1%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Retail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst industry for CFO turnover is retail, where the turnover rate over the last ten years has been &lt;strong&gt;18.3%&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly enough, companies in the retail industry also get sued in securities class action suits &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-five-riskiest-industries-for-securities-class-action-litigation/&quot;&gt;more often&lt;/a&gt; than any other industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in the retail industry can have all sorts of difficulty accounting related challenges for the CFOs to handle.

&lt;p&gt;The CFO position may be one of the most important positions at any public company. Financial problems at a public company tend to fall in the lap of the CFO first. If the CFO departs under troubling circumstances, that can be a signal of trouble down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence Molloy &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-iii-major-cfo-change-a-warning-sign-of-litigation/&quot;&gt;left Under Armour&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 for “personal reasons” it was a serious red-flag. Under Armour soon disclosed significant accounting-related problems, problems that have resulted in an SEC investigation and a Wells Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that our research consistently identifies &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;red-flag CFO changes&lt;/a&gt; as leading indicators for securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO changes have been rising steadily over the last ten years. In 2011, only &lt;strong&gt;10.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies reported a CFO change, whereas in 2020, &lt;strong&gt;15.1%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies reported a CFO change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/CFO%20turnover%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;CFO turnover 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO changes reached historic highs in 2018 and 2019. The turnover in 2020 represents a slight decline from those historic highs, although it remains the third-highest year on record. The overall trend continues to bend upwards, signaling continued volatility in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-flag CFO changes tend to follow the overall CFO turnover trends. Red-flag changes have also increased over the last 10 years, rising from &lt;strong&gt;3.1%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2011 to &lt;strong&gt;4.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
