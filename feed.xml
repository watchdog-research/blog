&lt;p&gt;Every publicly traded company must disclose how much money they pay their independent auditor, and thanks to Sarbanes Oxley, they must disclose how much money was for audit services (audit fees) and how much was for services unrelated to the audit (non-audit fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent audit firms have expertise in a wide range of services, so it is not unusual for a company to hire their auditor for services unrelated to their audit. In fact, despite the independence concern it can create, our research shows that companies with higher non-audit fees are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/auditors-can-help-prevent-costly-litigation/&quot;&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to be subject to securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a spike in non-audit fees can be a cause for concern. A dramatic increase in non-audit fees does not necessarily indicate a negative event, but it does indicate that something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; is occurring and that it requires the expertise of an accounting firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spikes in Non-Audit Fees Can Foreshadow Negative Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Under Armour reported a dramatic spike in non-audit fees. In November 2019, the Wall Street Journal broke a story that Under Armour was subject to an SEC investigation concerning their accounting practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that Under Armour’s increase in non-audit fees were related to navigating the investigation and remediating the problems that led to the SEC investigation. The SEC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-78&quot;&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; the case for $9 million less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spikes in Non-Audit Fees Can Merely Accompany Complicated Financial Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spike in non-audit fees signals a new event, but not necessarily one that is negative. For example, in 2016 Hilton Hotels paid non-audit fees of over $13 million, a &lt;strong&gt;181%&lt;/strong&gt; increase over the prior year. This increase was primarily due the complicated tax implications for Hilton’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/hilton-completes-split-into-three-independent-companies/2017/01/06/04414772-d287-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html&quot;&gt;spinoff&lt;/a&gt; into three distinct entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Example of Motorola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola is a casualty of the iPhone. From dominance to relative obscurity, the company has all but faded from memory (although it remains a relatively large company with $33 billion in market capitalization).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Motorola had the largest percentage increase in non-audit fees of any company over the last five years, rising &lt;strong&gt;2,200%&lt;/strong&gt; from $100,000 to $2.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Motorola%20non-audit%20fees.png&quot; alt=&quot;Motorola non-audit fees.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increase was probably due in part to Motorola’s auditor change, from KPMG (which had served as their auditor for over 50 years) to PricewaterhouseCoopers. It is also interesting that Motorola’s CFO departed in June, 2020, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/68505/000119312520184064/d939178d8k.htm&quot;&gt;personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;not claiming&lt;/em&gt; that Motorola has done something wrong. But unexplained change carries risk, and our job at Watchdog is to help investment and insurance professionals spot risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We contacted Motorola for comment and they simply replied that non-audit fees for 2021 were disclosed on page 76 of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/68505/000119312521103275/d25774ddef14a.htm&quot;&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disclosure of audit and non-audit fees gives some limited insight into a company. If the fees are changing, it must be because something at the company is changing. Although oftentimes the explanation is readily available to investors, sometimes it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is important to know what you do not know. For D&amp;amp;O insurance professionals, it is important to spot these potential risks and get explanations from the company when underwriting a policy or renewing a contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Audit Fees and Independence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur Anderson was famously paid more by Enron for consultancy work than for audit work. Arthur Anderson’s loss of independence, along with allegations that they had participated in Enron’s fraud, destroyed the largest accounting firm in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation currently requires that every public company disclose how much money it pays its auditor. Companies must also distinguish between money paid for the legally required audit (audit fees), and money paid for other services (non-audit fees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators like the SEC and the FRC are concerned with the effect that non-audit work can have on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.auditanalytics.com/changes-to-auditor-independence-regulations-us-vs-uk/&quot;&gt;auditor independence&lt;/a&gt;. Different regulators have different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifac.org/system/files/meetings/files/2901.pdf&quot;&gt;thresholds&lt;/a&gt; for deciding when non-audit work potentially raises a red flag for independence issues, ranging from 10-30% of the total fee. Despite the widespread agreement by regulators that non-audit fees create independence issues, the academic literature is mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Watchdog Research we follow the lead of major regulators and assign a yellow flag whenever non-audit fees exceed 30% of the total fee paid to the independent auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Audit Fees are Negatively Correlated with Securities Class Action Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the Audit Analytics database, which has over 20 years of data, to examine the relationship between non-audit fees and securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that the presence of a yellow flag for non-audit fees in a given year is &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; correlated with securities class action lawsuits for that year. Companies with a yellow flag for non-audit fees were &lt;strong&gt;12% less likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more surprising, this negative correlation persists for the &lt;em&gt;following year&lt;/em&gt;. Companies assigned a yellow flag for non-audit fees in a given year were &lt;strong&gt;7% less likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be named a defendant in a securities class action in the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every public company has complex tax and accounting issues, but companies vary widely in how many resources they allocate to address these issues. It is possible that non-audit fees are negatively associated with litigation because these companies are dedicating more resources to resolving complex accounting and tax issues instead of letting them fester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment and insurance professionals should carefully consider the overall resources the company allocates to addressing complex accounting and tax issues, including non-audit fees. Too little investment increases the risk of costly mistakes, which can lead to costly litigation. For D&amp;amp;O underwriters, the level of non-audit fees could be a helpful factor to consider when setting a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFOs play a crucial role at every public company. They are the ones primarily responsible for ensuring that the financial reporting is accurate and complete. It is important for the CFO to be diligent, highly competent, and confident enough to fix problems when other members of management would rather have them swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research consistently identifies red-flag CFO changes as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;leading indicator&lt;/a&gt; of securities class action suits. This would indicate that an unusual CFO departure has a ripple effect that can create short-term and long-term problems at a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years &lt;strong&gt;13.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies replaced their CFO in any given year. However, some industries had significantly higher turnover rates. Here are the five industries (classified by NAICS code) that had the worst turnover rates for the CFO position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Pharmaceuticals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceuticals are well known for their volatility and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/impact-of-cyan-comparing-the-market-today-to-the-pharmaceuticals-of-yesteryear/&quot;&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; named in securities class action suits. Pharmaceuticals had an annual turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;15.1%&lt;/strong&gt;. The only surprising thing about their appearance on this list is that they aren’t higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Wholesale Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are companies that sell merchandise, energy, or even food to wholesalers. Their CFOs had an annual turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;15.2%&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the biggest companies in that industry Sysco (SYY), a food distributor, had red-flag departures for both their CEO and CFO in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes companies like Facebook, S&amp;amp;P Global, and Accenture. The CFOs in this industry had a turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;16.5%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Entertainment, Recreation, and Other Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes companies like Disney, DraftKings, and Planet Fitness. The CFOs in this industry had a turnover rate of &lt;strong&gt;17.1%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Retail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst industry for CFO turnover is retail, where the turnover rate over the last ten years has been &lt;strong&gt;18.3%&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly enough, companies in the retail industry also get sued in securities class action suits &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-five-riskiest-industries-for-securities-class-action-litigation/&quot;&gt;more often&lt;/a&gt; than any other industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in the retail industry can have all sorts of difficulty accounting related challenges for the CFOs to handle. For a cautionary tale, read our post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-part-ii-cam-raises-the-specter-of-channel-stuffing/&quot;&gt;Under Armour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CFO position may be one of the most important positions at any public company. Financial problems at a public company tend to fall in the lap of the CFO first. If the CFO departs under troubling circumstances, that can be a signal of trouble down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lawrence Molloy &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-iii-major-cfo-change-a-warning-sign-of-litigation/&quot;&gt;left Under Armour&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 for “personal reasons” it was a serious red-flag. Under Armour soon disclosed significant accounting-related problems, problems that have resulted in an SEC investigation and a Wells Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that our research consistently identifies &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;red-flag CFO changes&lt;/a&gt; as leading indicators for securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO changes have been rising steadily over the last ten years. In 2011, only &lt;strong&gt;10.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies reported a CFO change, whereas in 2020, &lt;strong&gt;15.1%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies reported a CFO change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/CFO%20turnover%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;CFO turnover 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO changes reached historic highs in 2018 and 2019. The turnover in 2020 represents a slight decline from those historic highs, although it remains the third-highest year on record. The overall trend continues to bend upwards, signaling continued volatility in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-flag CFO changes tend to follow the overall CFO turnover trends. Red-flag changes have also increased over the last 10 years, rising from &lt;strong&gt;3.1%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2011 to &lt;strong&gt;4.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of companies in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, a federal lawsuit has offered a rare glimpse inside the world of the Big 4 accounting firms. In Botta v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, Mauro Botta, a former senior audit manager at PwC, is suing the firm for wrongful termination and retaliation as a whistleblower. He alleges he was fired because he submitted a whistleblower complaint to the SEC. Botta has argued that PwC unlawfully retaliated against him for submitting a “reasonable” complaint. PwC has argued that Botta’s complaint to the SEC was the actual retaliation, and that he was properly fired for misconduct unrelated to his whistleblower complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complex case and has lots of interesting facets. If you want to really want to get a feel for the personal drama, the office politics, and the thorny issues at play, then we highly recommend you read Francine Mckenna’s reporting on the trial at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/&quot;&gt;The Dig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Her writing is well worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case, however, is about more than personal drama. The case raises questions about auditor independence, a core safeguard of our capital markets. In live testimony via Zoom we heard about how PwC and its employees navigated the tension that exists between serving the client and protecting auditor independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francine suggested we do some research on a specific accounting issue that came up during some expert testimony offered by PwC. PwC’s expert testimony concerned the reasonableness of the complaint that Botta filed with the SEC, a key issue in the case. But before we go any further, some context is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Botta was a senior manager at PwC (the position right below a partner), working on an audit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1175609&amp;amp;owner=exclude&quot;&gt;Cavium&lt;/a&gt;, a publicly traded company which had approximately $400 million in assets. Botta filed a memo with PwC in 2014 arguing that Cavium ought to declare a material weakness in its internal controls because it purportedly had 2 significant control deficiencies and 11 lesser control deficiencies. (fn.1) (1336) None of these issues by themselves would constitute a material weakness, but Botta argued that in their totality, these deficiencies demonstrated a lack of competency by the financial department that ought to constitute a material weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in the internal controls of a company that creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. A material weakness can exist even when the financial statements are not misstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding whether to issue a material weakness, audit firms consider the guidelines set forth in the PCAOB’s Auditing Standard No. 5. Those guidelines specify that some of the more prominent indicators of a material weakness include (fn.2):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraud on the part of senior management, regardless of the severity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restatements to correct material misstatements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A material misstatement from the current period identified by the auditor that would not have otherwise been identified by management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ineffective oversight by the Audit Committee&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an exhaustive list. The PCAOB’s guidelines also include a catchall provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, this catchall provision specifies that any deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that would cause prudent officials to conclude that they do not have a reasonable assurance that the company’s financial transactions are recorded properly may be classified as a material weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Botta’s memo to PwC proposed that a material weakness for Cavium be filed based on a lack of competency by the financial department concerning income taxes, treasury, and technical accounting. (1358-1359). Since Cavium did not have any fraud, material misstatements, or lack of oversight by the Audit Committee, this material weakness would have fallen under the catchall provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Botta’s memo was taken seriously by PwC and an assessment was performed by its National Office. The National Office disagreed with Botta’s assessment, and neither Cavium nor PwC issued a material weakness in 2014. Botta then filed a whistleblower report with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Assessment by PwC’s Expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, PwC hired an expert witness to assess Botta’s report, and the report by PwC. PwC’s expert witness spent twelve years in the SEC’s Enforcement Division and held the position of deputy chief accountant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to PwC’s expert witness, it is occasionally appropriate to issue a material weakness for a lack of competency, but that lack of competency is usually accompanied by red flags. (1360-61). The expert witness specified that these red flags were restatements, out of period adjustments, prior material weaknesses, previously identified deficiencies that remain unfixed, and a lack of experience in GAAP by the financial department. (1360-1361).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expert witness also stated PwC’s assessment of Cavium demonstrated that the company’s financials did not exhibit any of the red flags which he had previously mentioned. Cavium did not have a restatement or out-of-period adjustment. (1362) Nor did it have a prior material weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to PwC’s assessment, even though PwC had identified many control deficiencies in 2012 and 2013, Cavium was apparently able to remediate these deficiencies by the end of the year, so that all the control deficiencies Botta identified in 2014 were new deficiencies. (1368)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expert witness also reviewed PwC’s assessment of the expertise of Cavium’s financial department. This assessment focused on the prior experience of the staff and their tenure. According to the PwC expert’s testimony, Cavium’s accounting staff was comprised of numerous Big 4 alumni with significant experience in the industry. When PwC’s expert witness was asked if he had ever seen a material weakness issued based on incompetence when a staff had similar experience, his response was a simple “no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PwC’s expert witness concluded that the National Office at PwC came to a reasonable conclusion in deciding not to issue a material weakness for Cavium. Finally, the expert was asked the following question (and it is important because it speaks to the reasonableness of Botta’s whistleblower complaint to the SEC):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q. &lt;em&gt;Sir, in your entire career, including your 12 years at the SEC, have you ever seen a material weakness due to incompetency exist in these circumstances?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A. &lt;em&gt;Not in these circumstances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PwC’s expert has excellent credentials and a wealth of valuable and relevant experience. Yet even his experience is necessarily limited by the cases that crossed his desk, the clients he served, and the topics discussed by his friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were curious, and so was Francine, whether we could find a material weakness filed under comparable circumstances by a careful analysis of the publicly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking Through Our Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We performed our analysis using the Audit Analytics database, which includes every material weakness since 2004. The Audit Analytics database assigns each material weakness tags categorizing the potential issues at play in the material weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audit Analytics is used by over 300 universities, many different regulators, and prominent accounting firms. It’s the gold standard for accounting related data on public companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audit Analytics tags disclosures about issues that relate to competency for material weaknesses in two ways. One tag is used for a lack of competency by the accounting department, and another for a lack of competency by senior management. These two tags nearly always coincide because hiring an incompetent accounting department is a red flag that the senior management team is incompetent too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2020, publicly traded companies listed on the U.S. exchanges disclosed ineffective internal controls over financial reporting 4,444 times. Of those, 2,443 were tagged for incompetency in the accounting department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Material%20Weakness%20Competency%20Chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;Material Weakness Competency Chart.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, small cap companies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/small-companies-5x-more-likely-than-large-companies-to-report-control-deficiency/&quot;&gt;more than 5X&lt;/a&gt; as likely as large cap companies to declare a material weakness. Since Cavium was a large company, any analysis that includes small cap companies would be potentially misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a more comparable set of companies, we narrowed our search to competence issues at large cap companies. Additionally, we only looked at companies which had hired a Big 4 audit firm. We thought that these large companies, with plenty of resources and the expertise of a Big 4 firm at their disposal, ought to have accounting staff with comparable experience and expertise to Cavium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this search were far narrower, with only 98 material weaknesses that fit these criteria. These material weaknesses were filed by 69 unique companies, as some companies filed more than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PwC’s expert described a number of red flags that were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; in Cavium’s case. These included fraud, material misstatements or restatements, out of period adjustments, and prior material weaknesses. We combed through the 69 different companies and eliminated the cases where these red flags identified by PwC’s expert were present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This analysis has allowed us to conclude that from 2004 to 2020, 22 companies filed a material weakness under comparable circumstances to Cavium.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/MW%20over%20time%20chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;MW over time chart.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One factor that PwC’s expert discussed that we could not examine was unfixed deficiencies. That is part of an internal assessment done by a company’s auditing firm that never becomes public. So, it is possible that some of the 22 comparable material weaknesses that we identified were due to unfixed control deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how rare these events are, we are not surprised that PwC’s expert was not personally familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also note that declaring a material weakness is a big step for an independent auditor. There is no public information that allows us to measure the severity of the control deficiencies that lead to these 22 material weaknesses. They may have been comparable to Cavium’s deficiencies, or they may have been for more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of his testimony when PwC’s expert witness was asked if it is ever appropriate to file a material weakness for incompetence, he stated “It’s possible but only in very extreme circumstances.” (1360) Our analysis tends to confirm that assessment (so long as you exclude cases where the red flags for incompetency are also present).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, our analysis shows that material weaknesses &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; filed in similar circumstances to Cavium, but it is rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one of PwC’s clients, Allergan plc, who had assets of almost $150 billion, disclosed a material weakness in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1578845/000156459017002433/0001564590-17-002433-index.htm&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; due to a lack of competency concerning the tax implications of certain transactions between their subsidiaries. This material weakness did not result in any misstatements, but the lack of competency concerning tax issues created a substantial risk of misstatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Deeper into The Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting fact was that out of these 22 companies, only 8 were headquartered in US. This result stands in contrast with the fact that historically fewer than 20% of U.S. listed companies are located outside of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Results%20by%20country.png&quot; alt=&quot;Results by country.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disparity is possibly due to differences in culture between foreign affiliates of the Big 4 and the U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also categorized the result by global audit firm. Here we lumped the US and foreign affiliates of each firm together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Results%20by%20auditor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Results by auditor.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked at the &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; issue raised in the material weakness disclosure (oftentimes the material weaknesses touched on more than one issue). The two primary issues that companies had struggles with were 1) the interplay of IT systems and the financial controls, and 2) complex tax issues that their accounting staff struggled to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Primary%20Issue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Primary Issue.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal experience, even the personal experience of a well-qualified expert, has its limitations. A careful analysis of hard data will usually be more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that our analysis does not comment on whether Botta’s whistleblower claim was reasonable, from a legal perspective, in this case. However, there is a big difference between knowing that companies in similar circumstances to Cavium &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;rarely&lt;/em&gt; issued material weaknesses as opposed to believing that companies in similar circumstances &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; issued a material weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

One core reform was to require every company’s management team to annually assess and report on the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is derived from a report generated by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, titled “Frequency and Impact of Control Deficiencies: 2020.” The full report is currently available at no cost, just email jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com and ask for the report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure controls are the policies and procedures that ensure a company can provide timely, accurate, and reliable financial information to the SEC and the market. When a company has disclosure control problems, it does not &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; mean that their financial information is not reliable, but it does mean that the company &lt;em&gt;cannot be sure&lt;/em&gt; that the information is reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, the law also required the independent auditor to independently assess and attest to the quality of the internal controls. However, this attestation requirement, known as SOX 404(b), has been narrowed in scope &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/slacker-standards-sec-exempts-even-more-companies-from-404-b/&quot;&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the SOX 404(a) requirement for management to annually report on the effectiveness of internal controls has remained intact. Additionally, the SOX 302 requirement for management to report quarterly on any disclosure control issues has also remained in effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management always has a strong interest in minimizing negative events, and we will touch on how that effects how they report on control issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control Deficiencies Continue Long-Term Trend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control deficiencies have been increasing at a steady rate over the last ten years. In 2019 a record number of control deficiencies were disclosed, but in 2020 there was a return to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Control%20Deficiencies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Control Deficiencies.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control Deficiencies Are Primarily Reported by Small Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 5,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges. Although larger companies receive the majority of investor and media attention, there are far more small companies than large companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often important to segment the market by size because companies of different sizes have different regulatory and reporting requirements, so they are often operating in different environments. For example, smaller reporting companies with less than $75 million in public float don’t have to comply with 404(b), neither to Emerging Growth Companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These small companies still need to assess their internal controls, but that assessment is not independently verified by their auditor. This lack of verification can result in companies “phoning-in” their assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to “phone-in” the assessment is to provide an adverse opinion. This is safer than claiming that internal controls are good, and risk being humiliated if they are eventually forced to file a restatement. And since so many other small companies are filing adverse opinions, the announcement of an adverse opinion on a small company has relatively little impact. After all, many people expect small companies to lack the resources necessary to implement rigorous controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adverse opinions by management are far more meaningful for large companies. Since the independent auditors at large companies provide their own independent assessment of internal controls, management is strongly incentivized to implement and maintain rigorous controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different incentives at play create a remarkably different results when we segment the company population by size. Small companies were over 5 times more likely to report a control deficiency than large companies. This is consistent with our research demonstrating that small companies are far more likely to report a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-impact-of-restatements-the-bigger-they-are-dot-dot-dot/&quot;&gt;restatement &lt;/a&gt;than large companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Deficiencies%20by%20Market%20Cap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deficiencies by Market Cap.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller companies are more likely to report control deficiencies than larger companies. This is probably due to the differences in stakes. With considerably less attention and lower expectations, it is easy for management at smaller companies to save time and money by truncating their assessment of internal controls by giving themselves a failing grade. And since so many of their peers give themselves this same failing grade, there is little pressure to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always expect companies to take the easiest road. Since SOX has created a two-tier system, with one set of rules for small companies and another set of rules for large companies, we are not surprised to see wildly disparate results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john_cheffers</name></author><category term="Internal Controls" /><category term="featured" /><category term="Internal Controls" /><summary type="html">After the Enron scandal, Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) to improve the quality of financial reporting and deter fraud.

We recently completed a report on the particular risks by foreign listings entitled Foreign Restatements and Securities Class Actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a summary of our report on Foreign Restatements and Securities Class Actions authored by Joseph Burke and John Cheffers. If you would like access to the complete report at no cost, please email jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securities class action suits against Chinese companies rose significantly in 2020, despite an overall decline in securities class action suits. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; observed that nearly half of the suits filed against Chinese companies were the result of an activist short report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the proliferation of these short reports and resulting securities class action suits is due to &lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt;. In January 2020, Muddy Waters published an anonymous short report accusing the Luckin Coffee of fraud. Shortly afterwards, in April of 2020, Luckin admitted to an egregious fraud. Their stock lost over 90% of its value, most of it in a single day, with the result that the stock was later delisted and eventually declared bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckin Coffee was not Muddy Water’s first successful take down of a Chinese company, but the fraud revealed at Luckin was so brazen, and at such a large and well-known company, that it shook the confidence of the entire market. &lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt; occurs when the problems at a single company reveal systemic problems that are so pervasive in a sector of the market that it undermines the entire sector. Our research into foreign restatements (included in this report) indicates that investors already had less confidence in U.S. listed foreign companies than in U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an enormous fraud seems only to have been possible with serious systemic weaknesses in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-clash-over-pcaob/&quot;&gt;audit quality&lt;/a&gt;,  regulatory integrity, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/divided-loyalty-something-is-rotten-in-beijing/&quot;&gt;corporate governance&lt;/a&gt;.  The systemic vulnerability to fraud in China has become so glaring that Congress has seen fit to pass the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/945&quot;&gt;Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act&lt;/a&gt;.”  This law could result in the delisting of every Chinese company from U.S. exchanges if the PCAOB is not permitted to inspect Chinese audit firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt; has reduced investors’ confidence in the financial reporting of U.S. listed Chinese companies, making them a perfect target for activist short sellers. It is difficult to say just how long this effect will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign Listings Have Increased to an All-Time High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years, the overall number of companies listed on U.S. Exchanges has held relatively steady, but the portion of foreign companies has increased significantly.  In fact, foreign listings are at an all-time high. Foreign listings have increased rapidly, from 962 in 2017 to 1,064 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increase is primarily fueled by an increase in Chinese company listings. They account for 75% of new foreign listings between 2017 and 2020.  The Chinese listings on U.S. exchanges increased from 181 in 2017 to 260 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increasing Litigation Risk for Foreign Listings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As foreign companies have listed in greater numbers, they have been named in an increasing number of securities class action suits. Foreign defendants in SCAs increased from a low of 29 in 2014 to a high of 67 in 2020. This holds true for Chinese companies as well; Chinese defendants in securities class actions increased from 5 in 2016 to 24 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the litigation rate for Chinese companies has been increasing steadily since 2016. Here is a chart comparing the probability of being named in a securities class action suit for U.S. companies, foreign companies, and Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Probability%20for%20SCA%20Chinese.%20Foriegn.%20Overall.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probability for SCA Chinese. Foriegn. Overall.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the introduction, the divergence of the rates of litigation for China from the overall trends is partly due to a proliferation of short reports against Chinese companies. After Luckin Coffee’s fraud was revealed in April 2020, more of the investing public became aware of systemic weaknesses in Chinese corporate governance, accounting quality, and regulatory enforcement. These weaknesses make Chinese companies more appetizing targets for short sellers and resulting securities class action litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securities Class Actions Have a Larger Impact on Smaller Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We measure the impact of securities class actions and foreign restatements by looking at abnormal returns.  Abnormal returns are the average returns to the stock in the 60-day window around the event less average returns to the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average abnormal returns to securities class action are -7.6% across all companies. Securities class actions tend to have a larger impact on smaller companies and a smaller impact on larger companies. Average abnormal returns are -2.4% for large cap companies, -5.2% for mid cap companies, and -12.4% for large cap companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20impact%20by%20size-1cd0ee.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA impact by size-1cd0ee.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Restatements Have the Largest Impact on Chinese and Foreign Listings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of foreign financial restatements differs significantly those for U.S. companies. Average abnormal returns to financial restatements are -7.5% for foreign companies compared to -4.7% for U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of restatements on Chinese companies is even more pronounced. Their average abnormal returns are -9.4%.  This is due in no small part to Luckin Coffee, which had abnormal returns of -92% following their restatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Abnormal%20Returns%20for%20Restatements%20by%20country.png&quot; alt=&quot;Abnormal Returns for Restatements by country.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuing disparity in abnormal returns between U.S. companies and foreign companies may indicate a confidence deficit. It appears that investor confidence is more easily shaken by a foreign restatement than by a domestic one. This seems to be particularly true of Chinese companies, a situation that has been greatly exasperated by &lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt;. This confidence deficit help explain why foreign companies—especially Chinese companies—are more appetizing targets for short sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not sure how long &lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt; will last, but it seems possible that the mere passage of time will not restore confidence in Chinese companies. Confidence is more likely to be restored by some sort of event demonstrating that the systemic weaknesses revealed by the Luckin fraud are being seriously addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies make up nearly a quarter of all offshore U.S. listed companies and their probability for being named in a securities class action surpasses that any other country. In 2020, this increase appears to be largely due to &lt;em&gt;The Luckin Effect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that U.S. and foreign companies trade seamlessly on U.S. exchanges, the truth is that these two types of companies operate in very different legal and regulatory environments. The risks associated with Chinese companies in particular are substantially different from U.S. companies, and investors, lenders, insurers and other financial professionals are wise to consider these differences when evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;

We calculate the abnormal returns by comparing how the company performed to how the S&amp;amp;P 500 performed on average over the same 30-day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 10% in the 30-days following a lawsuit against company X, and the company X’s stock remained at the same price during that period, then we calculate an abnormal return of -10% for company X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a histogram for all the abnormal returns for all securities class actions from 2011-2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20Histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA Histogram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to note about this chart. Firstly, about one third of the time the company’s share value increases after a securities lawsuit is filed. Most people would consider getting named as a defendant in a lawsuit as bad news, so the most likely explanation for the modest increase we see in a about a third of cases comes from positive developments that cancel out the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, about a third of the time the lawsuit coincides with a relatively modest underperformance by the company, with abnormal returns of zero to -10%. This is partially due to the fact that the impact of securities class actions on large companies tends to be significantly less than their impact on small companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20impact%20by%20size.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA impact by size.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large cap companies have access to more resources that can help them mitigate the impact of a securities class action suit. Large companies can afford a PR firm and can take steps to change the media narrative. Additionally, investors may think that the lawsuit is immaterial if the company is large and wealthy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing to note about the table is that it is skewed to the left. About a third of the time the company named as a defendant will have abnormal returns that are worse than -10%. In comparison, fewer than one-tenth of companies had positive returns that were better than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicates that securities lawsuits pose a significant risk of intense losses for any given company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our regular readers are aware that we regularly put out reports on the impact that restatements, securities litigation, and material weaknesses have on public companies. Currently we are working on a report that will meld some of this analysis with a special focus on foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our report, and this article, a foreign company is defined as a company that is incorporated outside the United States, but publicly traded the Nasdaq or NYSE. These companies have different filing requirements than publicly traded companies incorporated in the United States. They use different forms and are exempt from certain disclosure requirements (e.g. insiders only &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-insider-trading-and-stock-pledging/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on ownership and trading activity once a year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past ten years restatements have had a far greater negative impact on foreign companies than on U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%20Returns%20by%20Region.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements Returns by Region.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Question of Confidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share prices reflect the confidence of investors and the market. When a company issues a restatement, that can undermine the confidence of investors and result in a decline in stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that the reaction to a restatement by a foreign company is more severe than the reaction to a restatement by a domestic company. This leads us to believe that the confidence of investors in foreign companies is more easily shaken than for domestic companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, investors are not as confident in the stability of foreign companies as they are in of U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One implication is that foreign companies are a much more appetizing target for activist &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;short sellers&lt;/a&gt;. Our research indicates that investors lose confidence in foreign companies more easily, so a damaging short report is more likely to generate strong returns for the short seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another implication is that foreign companies who file restatements are an easier target for plaintiff’s firms, which can use the price swings following an event like a restatement to establish damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a difficult year for most companies. The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged industries and impacted how nearly every company does its business. One bright spot for U.S. public companies was that their probability of filing a restatement fell to an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these numbers do not include restatements from foreign companies, nor do they include “revisions” that are disclosed outside of the annual or quarterly filings. We are going to address those topics in a later report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is derived from “2020: Frequency and Impact of Restatements” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restatements and Securities Class Action Suits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restatements are often followed by a securities class action suit. The reason is simple enough. A company usually files a restatement to correct mistakes that they made due to an internal control problem. This correction results in a loss of confidence and a drop in the share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff’s attorneys then file a lawsuit claiming that the management of the company intentionally made misrepresentations in the past (which have now been corrected in the restatement). The drop in share price helps establish damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every restatement will result in a lawsuit for a variety of reasons, but there is a well-established pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year restatements and securities class action &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; both declined. Securities lawsuits do not always follow the restatement trend considering that restatements have trended down over the past decade while securities class action lawsuits hit historic &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-post-cyan-paradigm/&quot;&gt;highs&lt;/a&gt; over the last three years. But the number of restatements remains a significant contributing factor to the overall number of securities class action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restatements were down significantly for U.S. companies in 2020, reaching a new low. It is not clear if this decline has something to do with the coronavirus, or if it is simply the continuation of a long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in restatements has likely contributed to the decline in securities class action suits that also occurred in 2020, although restatements traditionally have minor impact on the overall securities class action trends.&lt;/p&gt;
