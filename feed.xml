We calculate the abnormal returns by comparing how the company performed to how the S&amp;amp;P 500 performed on average over the same 30-day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 10% in the 30-days following a lawsuit against company X, and the company X’s stock remained at the same price during that period, then we calculate an abnormal return of -10% for company X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a histogram for all the abnormal returns for all securities class actions from 2011-2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20Histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA Histogram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to note about this chart. Firstly, about one third of the time the company’s share value increases after a securities lawsuit is filed. Most people would consider getting named as a defendant in a lawsuit as bad news, so the most likely explanation for the modest increase we see in a about a third of cases comes from positive developments that cancel out the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, about a third of the time the lawsuit coincides with a relatively modest underperformance by the company, with abnormal returns of zero to -10%. This is partially due to the fact that the impact of securities class actions on large companies tends to be significantly less than their impact on small companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20impact%20by%20size.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA impact by size.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large cap companies have access to more resources that can help them mitigate the impact of a securities class action suit. Large companies can afford a PR firm and can take steps to change the media narrative. Additionally, investors may think that the lawsuit is immaterial if the company is large and wealthy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing to note about the table is that it is skewed to the left. About a third of the time the company named as a defendant will have abnormal returns that are worse than -10%. In comparison, fewer than one-tenth of companies had positive returns that were better than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicates that securities lawsuits pose a significant risk of intense losses for any given company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our regular readers are aware that we regularly put out reports on the impact that restatements, securities litigation, and material weaknesses have on public companies. Currently we are working on a report that will meld some of this analysis with a special focus on foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our report, and this article, a foreign company is defined as a company that is incorporated outside the United States, but publicly traded the Nasdaq or NYSE. These companies have different filing requirements than publicly traded companies incorporated in the United States. They use different forms and are exempt from certain disclosure requirements (e.g. insiders only &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-insider-trading-and-stock-pledging/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on ownership and trading activity once a year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past ten years restatements have had a far greater negative impact on foreign companies than on U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%20Returns%20by%20Region.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements Returns by Region.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Question of Confidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share prices reflect the confidence of investors and the market. When a company issues a restatement, that can undermine the confidence of investors and result in a decline in stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that the reaction to a restatement by a foreign company is more severe than the reaction to a restatement by a domestic company. This leads us to believe that the confidence of investors in foreign companies is more easily shaken than for domestic companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, investors are not as confident in the stability of foreign companies as they are in of U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One implication is that foreign companies are a much more appetizing target for activist &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;short sellers&lt;/a&gt;. Our research indicates that investors lose confidence in foreign companies more easily, so a damaging short report is more likely to generate strong returns for the short seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another implication is that foreign companies who file restatements are an easier target for plaintiff’s firms, which can use the price swings following an event like a restatement to establish damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a difficult year for most companies. The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged industries and impacted how nearly every company does its business. One bright spot for U.S. public companies was that their probability of filing a restatement fell to an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these numbers do not include restatements from foreign companies, nor do they include “revisions” that are disclosed outside of the annual or quarterly filings. We are going to address those topics in a later report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is derived from “2020: Frequency and Impact of Restatements” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restatements and Securities Class Action Suits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restatements are often followed by a securities class action suit. The reason is simple enough. A company usually files a restatement to correct mistakes that they made due to an internal control problem. This correction results in a loss of confidence and a drop in the share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff’s attorneys then file a lawsuit claiming that the management of the company intentionally made misrepresentations in the past (which have now been corrected in the restatement). The drop in share price helps establish damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every restatement will result in a lawsuit for a variety of reasons, but there is a well-established pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year restatements and securities class action &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; both declined. Securities lawsuits do not always follow the restatement trend considering that restatements have trended down over the past decade while securities class action lawsuits hit historic &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-post-cyan-paradigm/&quot;&gt;highs&lt;/a&gt; over the last three years. But the number of restatements remains a significant contributing factor to the overall number of securities class action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restatements were down significantly for U.S. companies in 2020, reaching a new low. It is not clear if this decline has something to do with the coronavirus, or if it is simply the continuation of a long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline in restatements has likely contributed to the decline in securities class action suits that also occurred in 2020, although restatements traditionally have minor impact on the overall securities class action trends.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, the number of securities class action suits filed receded from these all-time highs, but it is unclear whether the reduction is a temporary departure from a new paradigm, or the beginning a of a return to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20Probability%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA Probability 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is partially derived from “2020: Frequency and Impact of Securities Class Actions” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend of overall decline in 2020 does not apply to all types of cases. In a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/2020-short-reports-fuel-lawsuits-against-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; we looked at how cases against Chinese companies in 2020 bucked this trend and increased sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will look at two industries, biotech, and pharmaceuticals. (Our classification system may vary slightly from others you are familiar with because we classify companies by NAICS codes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/SCA%20biotech%20and%20pharma%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;SCA biotech and pharma 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the graph, suits against pharmaceuticals in 2020 declined, but remained in line with the average number of suits from 2016-2019. Suits against biotech companies remained almost identical to 2019, but the last two years are a significant downward departure from 2013-2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to draw too many conclusions from this data because the sample size is relatively small and subject to volatility. However, it is interesting that both industries were immune to whatever caused securities class actions suits to decline overall in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By our count, there were only 25 coronavirus related class action securities lawsuits in 2020. (There are some disagreements as to what should be considered a “coronavirus related” suit, which is why the count of “coronavirus cases” varies. We are shamelessly copying the count provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dandodiary.com/2020/07/articles/coronavirus/coronavirus-related-securities-suits-do-these-two-new-cases-count/&quot;&gt;Kevin Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, whose blog the D&amp;amp;O Diary is a must read.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, several companies in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries were subject to coronavirus-related lawsuits. Our total was 8, accounting for a significant portion of the cases brought against pharmaceutical and biotech companies. If not for the coronavirus, these industries would have probably seen significant declines in litigation, paralleling the overall downward trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern may repeat again in 2021 as two of the three coronavirus-related lawsuits filed as of February 15th were against companies in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. It appears that even if securities class actions continue to decline towards the long-term mean, there is a good chance that coronavirus-related lawsuits will keep biotech and pharmaceuticals at an elevated risk for litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Watchdog Research, we provide independent reports on publicly traded companies. Each company has two reports, a Watchdog Report, and a Gray Swan Event Factor Report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Watchdog Reports use red, yellow, and green flags to make it easy to spot potential governance, accounting, legal, and oversight issues. Our Gray Swan Event Factor (GSEF) estimates what kind of negative impact a company’s past will have on their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies have a relatively low GSEF score, in January 2020, only 5 large cap companies had scores over 5% (our threshold for considering a company “high-risk”). Here is a histogram of the GSEF scores for large cap companies. As you can see, even scoring above 2% is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Histogram%20GSEF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Histogram GSEF.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought it would be fun to revisit the high-risk companies after such an interesting year and see how they performed in 2020. When we look at each company, we will look at their GSEF on January 1, 2020, returns in 2020, any major red flags, and offer a brief analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aggregate, the few companies that we categorized as high-risk performed abysmally in comparison to the S&amp;amp;P 500, which gained 16.26% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/High%20Risk%20v.%20S&amp;amp;P.png&quot; alt=&quot;High Risk v. S&amp;amp;P.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Kraft Heinz (KHC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.15% GSEF: Extreme Risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return in 2020: 9.65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Red Flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Kraft Heinz issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/&quot;&gt;restatement&lt;/a&gt; impairing $15.9 billion in goodwill and intangible assets and disclosing serious internal control issues. In response, share prices fell by approximately 25%. The chaos from this restatement continued into 2020 as KHC was subject to multiple lawsuits, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-complaint-alleges-fundamental-corporate-governance-problems-accounting-shenanigans-and-insider-trading/&quot;&gt;derivative suit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kraft Heinz has slowly been recovering from its catastrophic fall in 2019. KHC stated in its second quarterly report that they have addressed the material weaknesses in their internal controls. However, KHC also impaired an additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745920000159/khc-20200926.htm&quot;&gt;$3.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in goodwill and intangible assets in the first nine months of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kraft Heinz has survived 2020. Their survival may be due in part to the coronavirus. It was a good year to sell comfort food in grocery stores. Buying the familiar brands under the Kraft Heinz umbrella probably gave people a much-needed sense of normalcy in an otherwise abnormal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that 2020 could have been a tremendous year for Kraft Heinz, but their past accounting issues and ongoing impairments may have kept them from properly rebounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.81% GSEF: High Risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return in 2020: -2.07%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Red Flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/bristol-myers-squibb-slash-celgene-merger/&quot;&gt;BMY merger&lt;/a&gt; with Celgene closed in 2019. When two companies of comparable size merge, the surviving company will typically underproduce in comparison to their peers for about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/borgwarner-wants-to-dump-delphi-will-delphis-resistance-be-futile/&quot;&gt;two years&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the surviving company must attempt to integrate two completely different companies, each with their own set of problems and peculiarities. The “synergies” often are mere puffery that never materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounting issues that arise out of a merger usually do not surface for at least a year. This is partly because accounting rules will allow companies to delay internal control assessments for the first year. So, it may take until 2022 to get a clear picture of the any challenges posed by BMY’s merger with Celgene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also note that BMY has not had a comment letter with the SEC since late 2018. A company of that size is typically reviewed every year and the letters are not released until some weeks after the conversation ends, so it is possible that they are working on some complicated issues. A lack of comment letters can also be due to an undisclosed SEC investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMY is suffering from the typical malaise that strikes companies post-merger. Since they do not produce vaccines and did not quickly develop a therapeutic for the coronavirus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/14272/000001427221000066/bmy-20201231.htm&quot;&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; they have a therapeutic in phase I of testing), they missed out on the government contracts and hype that so many other companies in the medical field benefitted from this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Baxter International Inc (BAX)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.24% GSEF: High Risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return in 2020: -6.56%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Red Flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, BAX had to delay its 10-k for 2019 because of internal control issues and a pending restatement. That restatement was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/10456/000162828020003693/bax-20191231.htm&quot;&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter and restated figures from 2017, 2018, and 2019. It has led to several serious and ongoing problems, including a costly securities class action suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last comment letter from the SEC was in 2017, even though it is likely that BAX is reviewed every year because of its size. In 2018, BAX’s numbers did not conform to Benford’s law. The presence of Benford’s law anomalies and the absence of comment letters both can be associated with an undisclosed SEC investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After disclosing the restatement, BAX warned that they may be subject to SEC enforcement. They did not say if their disclosure was due to an ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baxter is the only company on this short list whose GSEF was higher at the end of 2020 than at the beginning. They have had a challenging year. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/restatements-are-rare-but-can-pack-a-punch/&quot;&gt;typical&lt;/a&gt; for companies that issue a restatement to suffer stock declines has investor confidence plummets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAX produces medical devices, which is a growing field, but many of their customers (hospitals and similar businesses) experienced slow-downs this year as people shied away from receiving non-emergency care during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) (formerly CenturyLink)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.74% GSEF: High Risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return in 2020: -17.36%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Red Flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumen Technologies did not file their 10-k &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000119312519061757/d706860dnt10k.htm&quot;&gt;on time&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 due to a restatement. They also revealed internal control issues that were not fully resolved until the following year. As usually happens, the restatement resulted in a securities class action suit that is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumen’s stock dropped during March, like every other company, but unlike many other companies, it did not recover. This is mysterious considering that the coronavirus did not appear to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396578-shedding-light-on-lumen-technologies&quot;&gt;material impact&lt;/a&gt; on operations. Their poor returns this year may have to do more with a lack of confidence in their attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crn.com/news/networking/centurylink-changes-name-to-lumen-technologies-intros-smb-fiber-offering#:\~:text=and%20Technology%20Integrators-,CenturyLink%20Changes%20Name%20To%20Lumen%20Technologies%2C%20Intros%20SMB%20Fiber%20Offering,SMB%20services%2C%20the%20carrier%20said.&quot;&gt;revamp&lt;/a&gt; their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. TechnipFMC Plc. (FTI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.02% GSEF: High Risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return in 2020: -55.93%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Red Flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTI issued a restatement in 2017 and had material weaknesses in 2017, 2018, and 2019. FTI also has made 11 changes to accounting estimates in the last three years. In 2020, changes in accounting estimates had a positive impact of over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1681459/000168145919000104/technipfmc2019930-10q.htm#s31BD284795D659A194AE3E47EDF9B1B2&quot;&gt;$340 million&lt;/a&gt;. However, in 2019, the company also issued an impairment of $1.79 billion. FTI’s CFO departed in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their independent auditor’s critical audit matters disclosures highlighted risks in revenue recognition concerning long term contracts. FTI’s auditors warn that the estimates involved in these estimates require a lot of judgement and are subjective.  Uncertainty concerning revenue recognition is always a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTI was removed from the S&amp;amp;P 500. This is partly because of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/news/3649692-technipfmc-resumes-planned-split-via-energies-spinoff&quot;&gt;spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, but primarily because they were one of the worst performers in the S&amp;amp;P 500 during 2020. FTI’s industry, oil and gas, was hit particularly hard by a loss of demand due to the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock prices reflect the confidence and enthusiasm of the market. Accounting, governance, regulatory and legal issues rarely have a significant impact on stock price, unless problems in those areas manifest themselves in a way that dashes the market’s confidence in a company. Our GSEF metric can serve as a proxy for evaluating potential challenges a company will have in keeping (or regaining) the confidence of the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john_cheffers</name></author><category term="Red Flags" /><category term="featured" /><category term="Gray Swan Event" /><category term="Returns" /><category term="coronavirus" /><summary type="html">Five large-cap companies that we categorized as “high-risk” struggled throughout the year.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Gray%20Swan.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/Gray%20Swan.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">FINRA May Change Rules of the Game for Online Brokers</title><link href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/finra-may-change-the-rules-of-the-game-for-online-brokers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="FINRA May Change Rules of the Game for Online Brokers" /><published>2021-02-12T11:52:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-02-12T11:52:00-05:00</updated><id>https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/finra-may-change-the-rules-of-the-game-for-online-brokers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/finra-may-change-the-rules-of-the-game-for-online-brokers/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent guidance on “game-like” features from FINRA should concern every online broker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many media stories, the GameStop saga loomed large and made people feel that everything was about to change. But the moment has passed, and the media has moved onto the next novelty. But for online brokers, this story may end up having a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect of the GameStop saga was that many online brokers, most notably Robinhood, restricted their customer’s ability to buy certain volatile stocks, like GameStop. This exercise of direct control over the customers’ accounts was unusual and created an absolute uproar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a great deal of anger, some people even called for the brokers to be sent to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaPgBtf5m6w&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get into the weeds on why Robinhood halted trading, you should read Francine Mckenna’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/p/robinhoods-capital-and-customer-fund&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/reports/2021-finras-examination-and-risk-monitoring-program/communications-with-public&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; FINRA focused on online brokers who are attracting a great deal of interest from retail investors. They are primarily concerned by online apps that “include interactive and “game-like” features, as well as related forms of advertising and marketing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINRA has expressed concern that these features, which may improve the customer’s experience, will increase risk for retail investors. In their guidance, FINRA tells brokers that they must evaluate these “game-like” features to see if they “&lt;em&gt;constitute a ‘recommendation’ that requires a broker-dealer to act in a retail customer’s ‘best interest.’&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance directly undermines a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/online-brokers-are-dot-dot-dot-not-brokers/&quot;&gt;key position&lt;/a&gt; held by online brokers. For years, these brokers have required customers to sign agreements stating that they do not rely on their brokers for advice or recommendations; these agreements create paper shields that protect the brokers from liability and leaves the customers bereft of the suitability protections traditionally granted by the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a case decided in 2006, online platforms are not required to provide suitable recommendations because they do not have “&lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-scottrade&quot;&gt;discretionary authority&lt;/a&gt;” over their customers accounts. That legal assessment was obliterated when Robinhood and other online brokers took control over their users accounts in the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuCcchMOsKE&quot;&gt;protecting their customers&lt;/a&gt; from volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a somewhat related note, it is curious that the SEC allows ETF managers complete discretion to set an index and pick stocks without any consideration of whether the strategies or underlying are suitable for the ETF purchasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINRA’s focus on game-like features punches another hole in the online brokers’ paper shield. FINRA’s guidance explicitly expresses concern about the features that come with the mobile investing app that Robinhood pioneered and most online brokers shamelessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/robinhood-changed-online-trading-but-can-it-repeat-the-feat/&quot;&gt;copied&lt;/a&gt;. But FINRA’s concerns are not isolated to mobile investing, they are worried about how online brokers are influencing their customer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/2021-report-finras-examination-risk-monitoring-program.pdf&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; with their features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Such &lt;strong&gt;features affect&lt;/strong&gt; … &lt;strong&gt;how firms interact and communicate with customers&lt;/strong&gt;, from initial advertisements through the opening of accounts, recommendations and the presentation of different investment choices.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this guidance FINRA is opening the door to examining the relationships formed between online brokers and their customers, regardless of what the registration agreement says. And the scope of that potential examination is exceptionally broad, covering advertisements, marketing materials, and the website interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINRA may be contemplating some changes that will affect how every online broker does business. But instead of running from the legal obligation that brokers act in the best interests of their customers and provide suitable recommendations, they should find creative ways to meet these obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could provide a suite of tools that allow investors to easily understand and evaluate the risks that come with investing in any investment vehicle, from single stocks to ETFs. If those risk profiles were the product of unbiased and independent research, then it would be easier to convince FINRA that their features were not unduly influential.&lt;/p&gt;

We have already covered how Chinese companies get &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/only-the-good-die-young-chinese-delistings-part-i/&quot;&gt;delisted&lt;/a&gt; at higher rates than companies from other countries. Here we will look at the dramatic increase in securities class action lawsuits filed against Chinese companies over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is partially derived from “2020: Frequency and Impact of Securities Class Actions” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarborough, PhD, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-post-cyan-paradigm/&quot;&gt;Cyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, there was a sharp increase in the number of securities lawsuits filed across the board, but that increase was not evenly distributed. In 2016, Chinese companies only had a 2.7% probability of being named as a defendant in a securities class action suit. From 2016-2019 that probability increased every year, but it remained less than the average probability for all companies, until 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the overall probability that a company would be named in a securities class action suit fell below its historical high rates from 2017-2019. But the rates for Chinese companies moved in the opposite direction, shooting upwards to 9.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Chinese%20SCAs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese SCAs.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Reports Are Driving Litigation Against Chinese Issuers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone is familiar with the fall of Luckin Coffee, a Chinese unicorn purported to be the “Chinese Starbucks.” On January 31st, 2020, Muddy Waters announced it was short Luckin Coffee based on an anonymous 89-page short report. In April, Luckin Coffee &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that up to a third of its revenues and a substantial portion of its expenses from 2019 were fabrications. Luckin was delisted shortly after these revelations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, after Muddy Waters’ short report but before Luckin’s admission of fraud, the law firm Pomerantz LLP filed suit in the Southern District of New York against Luckin. Once Luckin disclosed the extensive fraud, another lawsuit was filed and eventually consolidated into the original suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case is both emblematic and an exception to the symbiotic relationship that appears to have developed between short sellers and plaintiff’s attorneys. Short sellers will typically publish reports alleging fraud at a company, resulting in a panicked sell-off. Afterwards, a plaintiff’s firm will file a lawsuit against the company, using the facts alleged in the short report to assert some sort of misrepresentation and use the loss in share value from the sell-off to prove damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Luckin was an exception because the short report was rapidly followed up by an admission of fraud and complete collapse, ultimately resulting in Luckin’s delisting. Generally, short reports do not result in the delisting of the targeted company. The impact of Muddy Waters’ success has already had tremendous implications in 2020 and will continue to echo in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imitation as Flattery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exceptional result for Muddy Waters seems to have encouraged other short sellers to target Chinese listed companies. By the end of 2020, 12 of the 28 securities class action suits filed against Chinese companies were based on short reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Chinese%20SCAs%20reason.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese SCAs reason.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muddy Waters followed up its own success with a short report for GSX. Wolfpack Research filed four separate reports on four different Chinese issuers. Hindenburg Research, fresh off its victory over Nikola Motors, issued a report on the Chinese company Kandi Technology. All these reports (as well as several others filed by Grizzly Research and Marcus Aurelius Value) resulted in lawsuits against the companies targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the courts will attempt to sever the seemingly inseparable duo of short sellers and plaintiff’s firms, but such a dramatic change is unlikely if even possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have previously discussed many of the systemic problems in China: the lax &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-insider-trading-and-stock-pledging/&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/a&gt; reporting requirements, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/divided-loyalty-something-is-rotten-in-beijing/&quot;&gt;corporate governance&lt;/a&gt; flaws, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-clash-over-pcaob/&quot;&gt;lack&lt;/a&gt; of meaningful oversight for their auditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems make it plausible that China has a serious and systemic &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/finding-fraud-chinese-delistings-part-ii/&quot;&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt; problem. To help factor in this risk for our clients, we penalize every Chinese company by automatically boosting their gray swan event risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more investors are becoming skeptical of Chinese companies, Western capital continues to flow into China. This abundance of fear and greed creates an ideal environment for short sellers. We suspect that short sellers will continue to target Chinese companies at elevated levels in 2021 and that securities class actions will follow closely behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETFs are a relatively new investment vehicle that has become extremely popular over the past decade. An ETF is an investment vehicle that is traded on the exchange like a stock, but it represents a basket of stocks, commonly referred to as an index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 the amount of money invested in ETFs eclipsed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/us-etf-market-tops-5-trillion-in-assets-as-investors-stampede-into-stocks-on-vaccine-hopes.html&quot;&gt;$5 trillion&lt;/a&gt;. ETFs have become popular in part because it their low fees, diversification, and tax efficiency. The key to their success is that they use an index, like the S&amp;amp;P 500, to create the underlying basket of stocks, so they do not use analysts to select stocks. Cutting out analysts lowers operating costs for the fund and lowers fees for investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETFs don’t use analysts to select stocks and they seldom do any due diligence on the companies in the underlying basket. Instead, ETFs file a prospectus explaining a set of criteria for its index populates the fund with companies that fit that criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ETF is only as safe as its index. The safest indexes are ones that track the whole market, or a more established list like the S&amp;amp;P 500. When investors buy into these ETFs they are avoiding the risk of picking stocks for a portfolio, since oftentimes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wealthrisecfp.com/blog/2019/12/6/should-you-let-a-monkey-pick-your-stocks#:\~:text=Can%20a%20monkey%20select%20a,well%20as%20any%20investment%20professional.%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt; can do a better job than the experts at picking stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in a conservative index is a logical way to avoid risk because the index is well diversified. However, that logic breaks down when the criteria used to select the index becomes too narrow or colored by biases and misconceptions. Sometimes the criteria for the index will preclude the sort of diversification that makes investing in an ETF so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, some funds use narrow criteria that make their portfolios far riskier, but most still don’t do any due diligence on the companies in the index. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etf.com/ECNS&quot;&gt;ECNS&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is an ETF that only includes small cap companies from China. We can’t think of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/only-the-good-die-young-chinese-delistings-part-i/&quot;&gt;riskier&lt;/a&gt; investment. Investors in these kinds of ETFs take on enormous risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there a lot of highly risky ETFs? Look at the sheer number of ETFs created over the last ten years and come to your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/NEW%20ETFS%202020.png&quot; alt=&quot;NEW ETFS 2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the number of new ETFs started every year has continued to grow, the total number of ETFs has increased as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/ETF%20Totals.png&quot; alt=&quot;ETF Totals.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, ETFs are not highly regulated. The lack of regulation is part of what makes investing in an ETF so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we are concerned that some ETFs sold to retail investors are sold without the proper fiduciary effort to warn the investors of the risks in the ETF. This exclusion of risk assessment would never be allowed if someone sold a mutual fund or other instrument to an investor. And no investor should buy any equity investment without fully knowing its risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>john_cheffers</name></author><category term="ETFs" /><category term="featured" /><category term="ETFs" /><summary type="html">The sheer number of new ETFs created annually indicates that many of them many represent highly risky investment strategies.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/ETF%20proliferation.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/uploads/ETF%20proliferation.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are We Making the Same Mistakes with ETFs that We Made with CDOs?</title><link href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/are-we-making-the-same-mistakes-with-etfs-that-we-made-with-cdos/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are We Making the Same Mistakes with ETFs that We Made with CDOs?" /><published>2021-01-29T10:22:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-29T10:22:00-05:00</updated><id>https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/are-we-making-the-same-mistakes-with-etfs-that-we-made-with-cdos</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/are-we-making-the-same-mistakes-with-etfs-that-we-made-with-cdos/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most ETFs aren’t technically derivatives, but they may pose similar risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CDOs were at heart of 2008 financial crash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the housing bubble burst, there was a lot of finger pointing. But one thing everyone agreed on was that collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were at the heart of the crash because people did not appreciate the real risks associated with these instruments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp#:\~:text=A%20collateralized%20debt%20obligation%20(CDO)%20is%20a%20complex%20structured%20finance,derived%20from%20another%20underlying%20asset.&quot;&gt;CDOs&lt;/a&gt; are a complex financial product backed by a pool of loans that can be sold to investors. Prior to the crash, it was believed that pooling together risky mortgages with solid mortgages would make the entire product safe, so many CDOs were AAA rated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, this should have worked, but there were some problems. Firstly, &lt;em&gt;no one buying these derivative products was checking the health of the underlying mortgages&lt;/em&gt;, so they did not realize that the CDOs were filled with far more risky mortgages than previously believed. Secondly, there was an assumption that the growth in housing prices would continue forever (seriously, what were people thinking?) and the system was completely unprepared for a decline, or even a slow-down, in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Few People Think About What is In Their ETFs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a tool that allow investors to easily invest in a pool of investments. These can be stocks, bonds, commodities, or some mixture. The value of the ETF is adjusted so that it reflects the value of the underlying basket of investments. Investing in an ETF gives the investor a share in the ETF fund, but not in the underlying assets that they reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying an ETF is considered less risky than purchasing an individual stock because there is diversification in the bundle that you are purchasing. For example, some ETFs track the entire market, or the whole S&amp;amp;P 500. The diversification can give a specific ETF the resiliency of the market (or whatever creates the pool of assets) so that risky companies are offset by more stable companies in the pool. Different ETFs offer differing degrees of diversification as some ETFs track relatively small subsets of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most ETFs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102815/are-etfs-considered-derivatives.asp#:\~:text=The%20short%20answer%20is%20that,not%20considered%20to%20be%20derivatives.&amp;amp;text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20ETFs%20are%20not,leveraged%20ETFs%20and%20inverse%20ETFs.&quot;&gt;not considered&lt;/a&gt; derivatives because they are backed by the actual assets in the pool, not some contractual arrangement based on the assets. However, the value of the ETF is &lt;em&gt;derived&lt;/em&gt; from the value of the underlying basket of stocks, so people can fall into a similar trap. They focus on the performance of the ETF and overlook the health of the underlying assets. This is the same kind of thinking that got so many investors in trouble with the CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funds Are Not Doing Any Due Diligence on Their Investments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another potential problem with ETFs. One reason they are considered safer is because they are usually passive investments. The managers use some criteria to create a basket of stocks and then generally don’t tinker with it. For example, some ETFs track the S&amp;amp;P 500 or the entire market; and they don’t try to pick winners and losers. Since ETFs don’t do research into the underlying assets, don’t have many employees, and don’t have to pay brokerage fees, it keeps costs low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospectuses for ETFs routinely warn investors that they do not research the assets that undergird the fund. Here is an example of some boilerplate from a prospectus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“[We] does not invest the assets of the Fund in securities or financial instruments based on [our] view of the investment merit of a particular security, instrument, or company, nor does it conduct conventional investment research or analysis or forecast market movement or trends.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to do this research for yourself. We can help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all ETFs cover broad and diverse markets, instead, some are incredibly specific. For example, there are approximately 50 “all-China” ETFs, each offering a different slice of the Chinese market. This is where the lack of research can really come back to bite investors on passive investments that feel “safe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ETF providers are not carefully researching the companies in their portfolio, but instead are putting together a set of criteria that they think will sell. &lt;em&gt;If an investor wants to know how risky the underling basket of stocks are, they need to do the due diligence for themselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can help with that. We have reports available for hundreds of ETFs that list and assess the underlying assets in the fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big difference between ETFs and CDOs is that the assets backing up most ETFs (stock from public companies) face far more scrutiny than the NINJA loans did prior to 2008. That does provide today’s investors in ETFs with more protection than the investors in CDOs had in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, investors need to be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security surrounding ETFs. They are skyrocketing in popularity, leading to a wide proliferation of different types of ETFs to satisfy every appetite. Investors should not get caught up in the frenzy, but instead make sure that they understand what they are putting their money into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy an ETF, especially a specialized one, then do your due diligence on the underlying stocks, because no one else is doing it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

They seem to want to replace traditional brokers, as evidenced by their marketing and the services they offer. Yet they do not want to take on the responsibility of making suitable recommendations for investors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to know the risks in your equity investments, read our independent research, available for individual companies and ETFs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the stock market crash in 1929, Congress acted to put more effective protections in place for investors. Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/divisionsmarketregbdguidehtm.html#:&quot;&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; a broker’s investment recommendations be suitable for each investor. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1879/pdf/COMPS-1879.pdf&quot;&gt;Investment Advisers Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1940, which required investment advisors to act as fiduciaries when advising and investing their client’s money. These laws ratcheted up the legal responsibilities of brokers and investment advisors by making them potentially liable for failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A crucial source for this article was a note in the Columbia Law Review by Alec Smith. You can read his note, “Advisors, Brokers, and Online Platforms: How a Uniform Fiduciary Duty Will Better Serve Investors” &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/CBLR/article/view/1730/751&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brokers are held to a suitability standard and courts have repeatedly found that a recommendation is suitable if it is consistent with the customer’s best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to FINRA’s guidance, for a broker to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111&quot;&gt;suitable&lt;/a&gt; recommendations they must first take reasonable steps to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the customer. FINRA’s rule states that brokers should pull together an investment profile that includes factors like the customer’s age, financial situation, tax status, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the broker must make reasonable recommendations that are in line with customer’s objectives. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2111&quot;&gt;FINRA&lt;/a&gt;, a broker is not permitted to “disclaim any responsibilities under the suitability rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1940 most people interacted with their brokers in person, or on the phone, but today many people use online brokers like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade. Like traditional brokers, these online platforms ask you questions and construct an investment profile. Many of these platforms also have online tools that will suggest investment strategies that correspond with the information you imputed into your profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online platforms will also attempt to teach you about investing through materials available on their website and through regular emails. This education should help you to recognize if the suggestions made by the programming is a good fit for your investing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Brokers Argue That They Are Not in a Position of Trust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unlike traditional brokers, these online platforms argue that they are not liable if they suggest an unsuitable investment. In essence, they argue that they should not be considered “brokers” as contemplated in the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. They argue that since they do not exercise “&lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-scottrade&quot;&gt;discretionary authority&lt;/a&gt;” over the client’s account, the client has not entrusted the money to the online broker and therefore no fiduciary responsibilities arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, online brokers require new users to sign an agreement before opening an online &lt;em&gt;brokerage account&lt;/em&gt;. The agreement will typically state that the user does not rely on the platform for any recommendations or advice concerning their investments. This language is designed to reinforce the notion that the online broker and the investor are operating at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a modified example from a top online broker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have not and will not rely on [Online Broker] or any [Online Broker] representative for advice, information or recommendations regarding Designated Investments, their nature or features, their risk profiles, or their suitability for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although rarely tested, these agreements have held up so far in court. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-scottrade&quot;&gt;Williams v. Scottrade&lt;/a&gt;, Inc., No. 06-10677, 2006 WL 2077588, at *9-10 (E.D. Mich. July24, 2006) a judge found that the online platform did not owe a fiduciary duty to its customer, and that &lt;em&gt;even if it did&lt;/em&gt;, the contractual agreement would have modified any duty owed. This case is hardly binding precedent for the whole legal system, but it stands for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could the Courts Change Their Minds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Williams v. Scottrade case was decided in 2006. Plenty of things have changed since then. The internet is no longer a sandbox where people keep some of their toys. It is rapidly becoming fully integrated into every aspect of our lives. Our dependence on the internet grows daily as online businesses slowly but surely replace traditional businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/CBLR/article/view/1730/751&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt;, Alec Smith argues that the suggestions online brokers offer based on a customer profile, along with the frequent educational material offered, could give a court grounds to find that online brokers exercise some de facto control over their customer’s accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, he argues that online brokers are … brokers. And that investors should have the same protections in their dealings with online brokers as they would have with traditional brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Hybrid Solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a practical problem with requiring online brokers to make suitable recommendations to investors. It would dramatically increase costs as the online brokers would need to communicate with every customer and assess their accounts to ensure that the algorithms had correctly identified suitable investments for the customers. Many of the competitive advantages that online brokers possess (cost savings, lower barrier to entry for investors), would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential hybrid solution would be for the online platforms to provide investors with lots of independent research, enabling investors to make truly independent judgements.  Here at Watchdog Research, we have independent research on almost every public company listed on a U.S. exchange, as well as on hundreds of ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the online brokers are operating in a gray space. They seem to want to replace traditional brokers, as evidenced by their marketing and the services they offer. Yet they do not want to take on the responsibility of making suitable recommendations for investors.&lt;/p&gt;
