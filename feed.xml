This risk is especially high in the first few years after a Chinese company is listed on a U.S. Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is derived from “Chinese Deslistings: Frequency and Causes” a research report produced by Joseph Burke, PhD, and John Cheffers, for Watchdog Research. If you are interested in accessing the entire report, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPO activity has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dandodiary.com/2020/11/articles/ipos/does-increased-ipo-activity-foreshadow-increased-ipo-related-securities-litigation-ahead/&quot;&gt;boomed&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, with October the busiest month in 20 years. For Chinese companies, this recent uptick continues a trend from 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Graph%20Chinese%20listings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph Chinese listings.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the previous IPO wave that crested in 2011, Chinese companies experienced a subsequent wave of delistings. Over the past ten years an average of 7.63% of Chinese issuers have been delisted every year, although that number has experienced tremendous variation year-to-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Graph%20Chinese%20Delistings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph Chinese Delistings.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the Chinese companies that made up the first wave of Chinese listings were small China-based issuers that gained access to the market via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-china-fraud-boom-nasdaq-steps-up-scrutiny-of-shady-listings-2016-06-20&quot;&gt;reverse merger&lt;/a&gt;. Small Chinese companies merged with defunct publicly traded companies, thereby getting onto U.S. exchanges through a “backdoor listing.” Many of these companies were later exposed as frauds, and the SEC and the Nasdaq eventually tightened up standards to prevent widespread abuse of these “backdoor listings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC and Nasdaq tightened their rules in 2011, which resulted in a number of delistings. But interestingly, Chinese delistings remained at elevated levels for several years, and rose again in 2019. For the first and later part of the past decade, Chinese companies have consistently delisted at a higher rate than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Delistings%20by%20country.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delistings by country.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that a good portion of early Chinese delistings were associated with the reverse merger scandal and that the SEC and the exchanges tightened restrictions in the aftermath of the reverse merger wave. But this table demonstrates that delistings for Chinese companies have remained high since 2015, despite the reforms that were made by the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that much of the recent IPO surge has been due to the proliferation of SPAC mergers, which are a hybrid of traditional reverse mergers and traditional IPOs. We don’t know how these SPAC companies will fare, but the early results have not been promising, with average returns of negative 9.6% according to a study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/71816/Updated-SPAC-returns-fall-short-of-traditional-IPO-returns-on-average#:\~:text=Of%20the%20313%20SPACs%20IPOs,for%20traditional%20IPOs%20since%202015.&quot;&gt;Renaissance Capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age at Delisting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key piece of our report looks at how long these companies stayed on the exchanges before they were delisted. Our research indicates that most Chinse companies were delisted within a few years of getting onto an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Age%20of%20delistings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Age of delistings.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows that most Chinese delistings occur within a few years of an IPO. That should give investors pause when they consider pouring their money into one of the many Chinese companies have listed in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No company is a sure bet, but some are riskier than others. Investors expect some up and downs in the market, but a delisting can represent a total loss of value in an investment, and the potential risk of a delisting should be a top concern when deciding where to invest. Investors should exercise great caution when investing in Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of our analysis, we also looked at when the circumstances surrounding these delistings raised concerns of fraud. But to see those numbers, you will have to wait for Part II.&lt;/p&gt;

Investors are rarely prepared for the bad news and have difficulty placing it into context; it is no wonder that for many investors the initial reaction to a financial restatement is a panicked sell-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is the antidote to panic, so we have looked at the data for restatements and other gray swan events to arm investors with as much information as possible &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; something bad happens. We produce reports on certain kinds of events, like restatements, that take a survey of the field and measure their impact on share price. Investors can also look at our company specific reports and our Gray Swan Event Factor to get a more granular view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we are analyzing the relative impact of restatements when segmenting the market by size. We have found that the impact of a restatement is proportional to the relative size of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog touches on a few data points from an extensive report produced by two of our researchers, Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarbrough, PhD. If you want access to the full report, email jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analysis for this report was primarily derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auditanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Audit Analytics&lt;/a&gt; restatement database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our research, we broke the market down into three segments, Large cap, Mid cap, and Small cap. In our analysis, Large companies have more $10 billion in market capitalization, Small cap firms have less than $2 billion, and Mid cap companies fall between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at how many restatements occurred for each segment over the past ten years and calculated the likelihood of incurring a restatement for each segment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%20by%20size.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements by size.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This table shows the financial restatements by size from 2010-2019. One thing to note is just how exceptionally rare it is for a Large cap company to issue a restatement. A Mid cap company is more than twice as likely as Large cap company to issue a restatement. And Small cap companies are almost seven times more likely to issue a restatement than a Large cap company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size Proportional to Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team also measured the impact of these restatements on share value. Our team calculated the impact by looking at how the stock performed in comparison with the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the next 30 days. Share price data was not available for every company which had a restatement, but we were able to get share prices for an adequately representative sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of our analysis shows that the impact of a restatement is proportional to the size of the company. Restatements have a large impact on big companies, but a smaller impact on smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%20abnormal%20returns.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements abnormal returns.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This table shows abnormal returns by size from 2008 to 2020 year-to-date. What explains this disparity? One factor may be the relative lack of attention and scrutiny on Small cap companies. Restatements for big companies are an unusual event, so when a Large cap company has one, the market experiences a strongly negative reaction to the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Large cap companies are also far more likely to be subject to a securities class action suit after a restatement, which can amplify the negative cycle and downward pressure on share value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our research, restatements have fallen steadily over the past decade. Restatements for Large cap companies are exceptionally rare, but when they do occur, they can be extremely harmful. But the same does not hold true for Mid cap and Small cap companies Our research indicates that the impact of a restatement is often proportional to the size of a company, so if a Small cap company issues a restatement, it may end up being small potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

People rely on this information and expect it to be accurate. Accordingly, a company must file a restatement if it determines that its previous financial disclosures were inaccurate, and that people should not rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog touches on a few data points from an extensive report produced by two of our researchers, Joseph Burke, PhD, and Joseph Yarbrough, PhD. If you want access to the full report, email jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analysis for this report was primarily derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auditanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Audit Analytics&lt;/a&gt; restatement database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that restatements have declined significantly over the past ten years, although the rate of decline has slowed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatement%20Probability.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatement Probability.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the annual share of companies filing one or more financial restatements from 2010 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline should bring a great deal of comfort to many companies since restatements are one of the most harmful gray swan events that we track. Restatements are often the opening salvo in a torrent of bad press. A restatement often occurs because of a substantial material weakness in the internal controls and often can precipitate turnover in the management team, particularly at the CFO position. Additionally, restatements often trigger class action securities lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis compared the returns over the thirty days following a restatement to the returns from the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the same timeframe.   The data shows that the typical reaction of the market to a restatement is negative (approximately 2/3 of restatements resulted in negative returns). The most common result is negative returns from zero to 10%, but a significant portion (approximately 15%) had a negative return of 20% or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Restatements%20Histogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Restatements Histogram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph groups companies by how their share prices performed in comparison with the S&amp;amp;P 500 in the 30 days after a restatement was reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis indicates that for many companies, issuing a restatement is a trying—but manageable—event. However, in a significant minority of cases, the losses can be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Notable Cases from 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the percentage of companies impacted by a restatement in 2019 was relatively low, some of the restatements that did occur had a near record-breaking impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pareteum Corp (TEUM)&lt;/strong&gt; had a restatement in October, 2019, and lost 69.6% of its value over the next 30 days ($119 in market cap). TEUM’s decline in value (as a percentage of its pre-restatement value) over the thirty days following its restatement was more than any other company in the last ten years. TEUM was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084384/000110465920115313/tm2033276d1_ex99-1.htm&quot;&gt;delisted&lt;/a&gt; in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kraft Heinz (KHC)&lt;/strong&gt; had a restatement in February 2019 that erased $12.7 billion in market cap after its restatement on February 9th, 2019. This loss in vale was the second largest in the last ten years. If you want to know more, you can read some of our analysis on KHC &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-complaint-alleges-fundamental-corporate-governance-problems-accounting-shenanigans-and-insider-trading/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/birds-of-a-feather-how-to-tell-a-gray-swan-from-a-black-swan-dot/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baxter International Inc (BAX)&lt;/strong&gt; had a restatement in October 2019 that erased $4.39 billion in market cap over the next thirty days. Even though BAX lost significantly less money than KHC, it was still the third largest loss of value in the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restatements today are far less common than they were a decade ago, although the rate of decline has slowed in recent years. Our research also shows that 2/3 of restatements have a negative impact on share price. Although the response to a restatement is generally negative, people may be surprised by the fact that 1/3 of restatements had &lt;em&gt;no negative impact&lt;/em&gt; on the share price after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though restatements are not as common as they used to be, a restatement can still be a catastrophic gray swan event, as is evident from the negative impact that they had on TEUM, KHC, and BAX in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These restatement numbers are just one facet of our Gray Swan Event Factor. With our GSEF we calculate the risk of gray swan events for over 4,500 publicly traded companies.

We will keep you apprised of any responses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 24, 2020, the PCAOB released a settled disciplinary order against Marcum LLP for a matter dating back to November 2016, when Marcum issued a single unqualified opinion for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 financial statements of a company incorporated in Delaware, but headquartered and operating primarily located in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of the story is that Marcum’s engagement team, as the signing firm for an audit where its affiliate, Marcum BP, was performing the work on the ground, inappropriately acquiesced to management and should not have offered an unqualified opinion of their financial statements. The disciplinary &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/105-2020-012-MARCUM-LLP.pdf&quot;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; contains all the interesting details and we encourage you to read it for yourself. But the most interesting thing about this PCAOB report is not what it found, &lt;em&gt;but that it exists at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions between China and the U.S. over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-clash-over-pcaob/&quot;&gt;accounting profession&lt;/a&gt; have been mounting for a decade. After Enron collapsed in 2001, legislative reform—the Sarbanes-Oxley law passed in 2002—created the PCAOB to provide independent oversight of the auditing firms via routine inspections. The law required every company listed on a U.S. exchange to be audited by an auditing firm that was registered with the PCAOB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According the SEC, the PCAOB, and the Big 4, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has simply refused to allow PCAOB inspectors to inspect Chinese audit work papers, declaring them “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other&quot;&gt;state secrets&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has taken other measures to cement control over its accounting profession. They ordered the Big 4 to hand over control of Chinese affiliates to Chinese nationals. In early 2020, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-audit-chinese-firms-market-frets-over-what-comes-next-11590485401&quot;&gt;outlawed&lt;/a&gt; cooperation with overseas regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these restrictions, or perhaps because of them, the share of audit opinions issued out Beijing has doubled in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dispute over the auditing profession belies a fantasy that the differences between China and the U.S. are merely accidental and not substantive— a fantasy held by a class of people hoping to benefit from China’s growth potential and foisted on everyone else through the normal institutional channels. However, the dispute over the PCAOB’s access to Chinese auditors shows that China and the U.S. are in separate worlds, playing by different sets of rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcum in the Middle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big 4’s response to the inconsistent directives of the U.S. and the CCP has been to bifurcate their firms and put a ring fence around their affiliates in China. Although the U.S. affiliates and the Chinese affiliates share the same global brands, they do much more than socially distance. Our research indicates that every Chinese client of a Big 4 firm has been audited by a local Chinese affiliate since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the safe way for auditing firms to do business in China. But the downside is that the CCP’s grip on information and refusal to allow PCAOB inspections makes everything that happens in China opaque. We cannot be sure of the quality of audits, or the integrity of financial reporting, and we have no idea if the CCP has been inappropriately pressuring auditors to give some companies an easy time. That is possible given how many state-owned enterprises there are in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read our previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/where-in-the-world-is-marcum-bernstein-pinchuk/&quot;&gt;piece &lt;/a&gt;on Marcum BP [Marcum BP is a separate entity from Marcum LLP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/pcaob-sanctions-marcum-from-doing-china-audits?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=accountingtoday-tw&quot;&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt; by a partnership between Marcum LLP and Bernstein &amp;amp; Pinchuk in 2010 and focuses primarily on serving Chinese clients], then you know that Marcum LLP and Marcum BP do not operate in the same way as the Big 4. Marcum LLP and Marcum BP are U.S. firms that provide audits for Chinese companies. Both Marcum firms, and a few other small firms, attempt to navigate the incoherent landscape created by the contradictory directives of China and the U.S. These firms have broken with conventional wisdom and exist in this strange place between the U.S. and China, and it’s not clear which rules apply in this no man’s land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCAOB settled disciplinary order against Marcum LLP points to its inspection of the audit of a company headquartered and operating primarily in China. That is inexplicable considering how everyone says that its impossible for the PCAOB to do that. According to the SEC and the Big 4, this inspection should not have been possible because the work papers are considered “state secrets” by the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, here is a settled disciplinary order based on an inspection of the work papers of an audit of the Chinese operations of a company. It is not clear how this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to our confusion, a Chinese newspaper has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/09/c_139275803.htm&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that China’s regulator claims it “&lt;em&gt;has never prohibited or prevented relevant accounting firms from offering audit work papers to overseas regulators&lt;/em&gt;.” That claim is inconsistent with the new law banning cooperation with foreign regulators and how the Chinese affiliates of the Big 4, the SEC, and the PCAOB have characterized the issue over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know the answer to this question, but we suspect that it may have something to do with the fact that both Marcum LLP and Marcum BP are U.S. firms, and not Chinese. The relatively small footprint of Marcum LLP and Marcum BP in China may also contribute to an inconsistent application of the “state secrets” rule.  The CCP is an authoritarian regime; accordingly, there is no reason to believe that the CCP would feel bound to follow the “rule of law” and enforce rules consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcum Alone in the Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is inexplicable how Marcum LLP was subject to inspection by the PCAOB, while none of the Big 4 affiliates in China are subject to the same scrutiny. We hypothesized that the state of incorporation was relevant, since the issuer inspected was incorporated in Delaware, but the data did not bear that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Marcum%20China%20incorporation%20location.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marcum China incorporation location.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pie chart is a representation of where Chinese companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq are incorporated. Most Chinese companies on the Nasdaq and NYSE are incorporated in tax havens, connected to their Chinese operations through VIEs. A significant portion of Chinese companies were incorporated in U.S. Only a relatively small portion of Chinese companies are incorporated in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we are not sure how it happened. However, it seems that Marcum LLP is the only firm with Chinese clients that has received scrutiny from the PCAOB. The PCAOB’s report on Marcum is certainly embarrassing and upsetting for a reputable firm with a lot of pride. Marcum has been barred from signing audits for Chinese companies for three years. But, given the context, it really should raise concerns about audit quality across China. The Marcum partners made this error even though they knew their work would be subject to meaningful review by the PCAOB; is there any good reason to believe that the audit partners at the Big 4 affiliates are holding themselves to a higher standard when they know the PCAOB cannot review their work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that makes this story so complex is that, on one hand, we would like to applaud Marcum’s relative transparency in comparison to the opaque Big 4 affiliates. But, on the other hand, they are rightfully taking their lumps over the lack of audit quality in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PCAOB Sanctions Will Not Have Much Impact on Marcum LLP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most attention-grabbing part of the PCAOB’s settled disciplinary order was the three-year ban on issuing audit reports for clients with substantially all their operations in China. But since Marcum LLP partnered up with Bernstein and Pinchuk in 2010, work in China has not been a significant part of their business in recent years. Our research indicates that Marcum LLP only had 8 clients in China in 2019. (Marcum BP has more, but they were not affected by these sanctions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Marcum%20clients%20in%20China.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marcum clients in China.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent increase is due to the proliferation of “blank check” companies, aka special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs); Marcum LLP specializes in SPACs. In 2019, four of Marcum LLP’s Chinese clients were blank check acquisition companies. Since SPACs do not really have operations, it is unclear if the PCAOB’s ruling will affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One critical point is that the PCAOB’s order does not appear to have any impact on Marcum BP, since they were only referred to as a related party and not a respondent in this matter. In contrast, Marcum LLP and Marcum BP were both subject to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcaobus.org/News/Releases/Pages/PCAOB-Sanctions-Two-Firms-and-One-Individual-for-Auditor-Independence-Violations.aspx&quot;&gt;disciplinary order&lt;/a&gt; from the PCAOB related to auditor independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if this settled disciplinary order has concluded this matter, or if the PCAOB will address Marcum BP separately for its role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcum LLP has an infinitesimal portion of the Chinese audit market in comparison to the Big 4, but their approach to navigating the contradictory directives of the U.S. and China provides more transparency and accountability than is available from the Big 4 affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is Marcum LLP and Marcum BP’s willingness to take on risky clients. In this case, Marcum LLP took over for another auditor which had resigned nearly a year earlier because of differences with the management team. Recently, Marcum BP took over the audit for Luckin Coffee from Ernst &amp;amp; Young Hua Ming LLP after a massive fraud was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That transparency, and willingness to take on messy situations from riskier clients has come at a cost for Marcum LLP, but it has provided an invaluable insight to those interested in audit quality in China. This report demonstrates how valuable PCAOB inspections could be for improving audit quality and accountability for management in China. Hopefully, the CCP and the U.S. will reach an agreement to bring the same level of transparency to all accounting firms in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We welcome guest posts on interesting topics. Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&quot;&gt;jcheffers@watchdogresearch.com&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to have us feature your work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in January &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-practice-of-reverse-factoring-raises-transparency-concerns/&quot;&gt;we discussed challenges&lt;/a&gt; involved when the risks of reverse factoring agreements are introduced. In 2020 the SEC issued comment letters to at least four companies, namely Procter &amp;amp; Gamble (PG), Graphic Packaging Holding (GPK), Boeing (BA) and Coca-Cola (CO) asking for more details about their reverse factoring agreements. This was after the SEC sent supply chain financing comment letters to Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and Masco (MAS) in 2019. In this blog, we would like to look at supply chain financing disclosures following the SEC reviews and discuss some of the language in the comment letters and disclosures that we find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s provide a quick recap. Reverse factoring agreements document the terms when a company helps a supplier sell the company’s accounts receivable in exchange for better credit terms. The supplier pays a fee to sell the receivables, and if the fee is small enough, the trade is a winner for all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000001292720000065/a202006jun3010-q.htm&quot;&gt;10-Q filing&lt;/a&gt; for the period June 30, 2020, Boeing’s trade payables included $4.4 billion payable to suppliers that participated in supply chain financing programs (SCF). Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/80424/000008042420000053/pg-20200630.htm&quot;&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt; disclosed that, as of June 30, 2020, the amounts due to suppliers that participated in SCF programs were about $4 billion. And Coca-Cola noted in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134420000041/ko-20200626.htm&quot;&gt;quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; that, as of June 30, 2020, suppliers elected to sell $714 million of the outstanding payment obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-asks-boeing-coca-cola-to-disclose-more-about-popular-financing-tool-11598526651&quot;&gt;WSJ article&lt;/a&gt; used fees generated by banks that participated in reverse factoring agreements to estimate the size of the supply-chain financing sector. According to the article, the fees in the first half of 2020 were $12.7 billion, up 3.6% from the previous year. To develop a complete estimate of the size of the supply-chain financing receivables sold we would also need to know the average fees charged by the banks (the fee for each company would, of course, be different and depend on the credit risk of the receivables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens if a major shock changes the credit environment and the sources of short-term liquidity suddenly dry up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major challenges with understanding the risk involved in supply chain financing are lack of disclosure, diversity in practice, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&amp;amp;blobnocache=true&amp;amp;blobwhere=1175836059659&amp;amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;amp;blobheadername2=Content-Length&amp;amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;amp;blobheadervalue2=667317&amp;amp;blobheadervalue1=filename%3DAR-2019.UNS.020.BIG_4_ACCOUNTING_FIRMS.pdf&amp;amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&quot;&gt;lack of regulatory guidance&lt;/a&gt; (we talked about that in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/the-practice-of-reverse-factoring-raises-transparency-concerns/&quot;&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;). In June 2020 the SEC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/covid-19-disclosure-considerations&quot;&gt;issued an update&lt;/a&gt; on what companies are expected to disclose to address pandemic-related liquidity concerns. Notably, supply chain financing was explicitly referenced in this update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Are you relying on supplier finance programs, otherwise referred to as supply chain financing, structured trade payables, reverse factoring, or vendor financing, to manage your cash flow? Have these arrangements had a material impact on your balance sheet, statement of cash flows, or short- and long-term liquidity and if so, how? What are the material terms of the arrangements? Did you or any of your subsidiaries provide guarantees related to these programs? Do you face a material risk if a party to the arrangement terminates it? What amounts payable at the end of the period relate to these arrangements, and what portion of these amounts has an intermediary already settled for you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the SEC comment letters process is to increase the transparency of financial reporting. For the most part, the SEC’s supply chain financing comments requested that the companies provide additional disclosures about the terms and materiality of the supply chain financing programs and their impact on liquidity and cash from operations. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://jimhamiltonblog.blogspot.com/2020/09/is-supply-chain-financing-disclosure.html&quot;&gt;Jim Hamilton’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (that we found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/&quot;&gt;TheCorporateCounsel&lt;/a&gt;) described in great detail the nature of the supply chain comments issued so far, so we will skip the general discussion and look at language that sets the letters apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134420000027/filename1.htm&quot;&gt;opening letter&lt;/a&gt; for Coca Cola is provides an example of interesting language on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We note from your disclosures that accounts payable increased roughly $1.1 billion in 2019 due to the extension of payment terms with your suppliers. &lt;strong&gt;We further note from external sources that it appears you have in place a supply chain finance program&lt;/strong&gt;.” (emphasis added)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for the SEC, as part of the comment letter process to review earnings calls, press releases, or media articles. A search of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auditanalytics.com/products/sec/comment-letter-threads&quot;&gt;Audit Analytics’&lt;/a&gt; comment letter database identified more than 800 companies which received a comment letter that was at least partially based on information disclosed during an earnings call. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, references to an “external source” are very rare. Disclosures about supply chain financing are limited, so it is not surprising that the SEC had to use a third-party source to confirm the existence of the agreements. It would be interesting to know if these external sources named other companies and whether more comment letters are coming. (We will keep monitoring the comment letter disclosures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to add a note about Boeing’s supply chain financing letters and relevant disclosures. A common theme among the supply chain financing comment letter responses was the lack of materiality of the supply chain financing on overall liquidity. Boeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000001292720000056/filename1.htm&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in its response that the company does not consider supply chain financing programs to be material to the overall liquidity. The company pointed out that they had decided to provide additional disclosure because of the significant negative liquidity impact that the company has experienced. The disclosure below is from the 10-Q filing for the period June 30, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and increased by $1.8 billion for the same period in the prior year. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The decline for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers and not due to any changes in the availability of supply chain financing. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2019 reflects a combination of higher purchases, an extension of payment terms with certain suppliers and increased utilization of our supply chain financing programs.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing included additional disclosures in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000001292720000065/a202006jun3010-q.htm&quot;&gt;10-Q filing&lt;/a&gt;, noting that while the access to supply chain financing can suffer if the company’s credit rating is downgraded, the company does not expect that the changes in availability of supply chain financing to have a material effect on liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the disclosure we have seen so far, companies tend to record supply chain financing in current liabilities, so extended payment terms following the supply chain programs may result in higher days payable. (For illustrative purposes, P&amp;amp;G &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/80424/000008042419000060/filename1.htm&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s days payable increased 8 days as of the June 30, 2019.) The challenge, of course, is to understand whether the increase in accounts payable was part of the supply chain financing, a general change in the account payable’s terms, or just an attempt to delay payments and preserve liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, receiving a comment letter does not imply that there is anything wrong with a company’s disclosures. The goal of a comment letter is to provide more information to investors, and we have seen increased disclosures of supply chain financing programs following the comment letter review process. For the companies that do not provide any supply chain financing disclosures (as we discussed above, a company may consider the program to be immaterial), investors can get a small hint by looking at the trends in accounts payable.&lt;/p&gt;

Tomorrow, on September 23rd, we will be attending (remotely of course)  a webinar hosted by PLUS on how companies can strategically handle cybersecurity concerns. We are an independent research provider that uses an extensive database of public information to create easy-to-use reports for over 4,500 publicly traded companies. Since we track cybersecurity incidents and all material litigation for public companies, we thought we could use this as an opportunity to provide a little color to the important discussions concerning cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began by looking at incidents that occurred at companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq over the past ten years, and the growth rate of cybersecurity incidents is alarming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Cyber%20Incidents.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cyber Incidents.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The graphs and tables in this post were created by Joseph Burke, PhD, and derived the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auditanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Audit Analytics&lt;/a&gt; database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, only .1 % of companies reported a cybersecurity incident. In 2019, 2.2% of companies reported a cybersecurity incident. The growth of cybersecurity incidents over the past five years has been incredible and it is not clear when it will slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting facet is that the risk of a cybersecurity incident is much higher at a large company that it would be at a small company. Attacks on large companies are driving much of the growth in these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Cyber%20Incident%20Table.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cyber Incident Table.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cybersecurity Security Class Actions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cyberbreach at a company creates all sorts of problems, including litigation. We identified all the security class action suits that were brought over cybersecurity issues and calculated the likelihood of being named in one of those suits. Unsurprisingly, the last ten years has shown significant growth in the risk of being named in a cybersecurity related lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Cyber-lawsuit%20prob.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cyber-lawsuit prob.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these percentages are for all companies. Large cap companies have a significantly higher probability than is represented in the graph because they are both more likely to be the victim of a cybersecurity incident and are generally more likely to have a securities class action suit filed against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cybersecurity as a Leading and Covariate Indicator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of our researchers, Joseph Burke PhD and Joseph Yarbrough PhD, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3562785&quot;&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; calculating when particular flags from our reports were associated with an increased risk of securities class action litigation for 2014-2018. Companies with a cybersecurity incident were almost three times as likely to get named in a securities class action lawsuit the year that the incident occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, cybersecurity incidents were one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;six leading indicators&lt;/a&gt; of securities class action suits. An event is considered a leading indicator of litigation if the occurrence of that event is associated with an increased risk of litigation for the &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chance of being involved in a cybersecurity securities class action lawsuit is still relatively low, but it is increasing rapidly. Additionally, the risk profile is far higher for large companies, which are more likely to be a victim of a cybersecurity incident and more likely to get named in a securities class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If company boards wish to prevent having their company victimized twice (by hackers and by lawyers), then they need to make wise and strategic decisions to confront this growing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s decision in &lt;em&gt;Cyan&lt;/em&gt; in 2018 was a big victory to plaintiff’s law firms because it opened the doors of the state courts to federal claims under the Securities Act of 1933. These state law cases had already been permitted in some jurisdictions, but &lt;em&gt;Cyan&lt;/em&gt; threw the doors open all over the country, with predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last three years, the percentage of companies named in a securities class action suit have been extremely high, hovering around 8%. This has been a great development for plaintiff’s attorneys, but a major problem for corporations and the insurers who provide D&amp;amp;O Insurance to cover the costs of these suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how disruptive this change has been, we compared the current level of litigation with the amount of litigation associated with what is considered the riskiest class of companies—pharmaceuticals. Our research indicates that over the last 10 years, that on average 7.45% of pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in securities class actions annually. If you were to compare the rates of security class action suits year over year between pharmaceuticals and everyone else, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Pharma%20v%20nonPharma.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pharma v nonPharma.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph was created by Joseph Burke, PhD, using data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auditanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Audit Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Audit Analytics uses NAICS codes to classify companies by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research indicates that over the last ten years pharmaceuticals have been the second riskiest industry for securities class action litigation (Education and Healthcare has been the riskiest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph demonstrates that the average company is now much more likely to be named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit than a company in a very risky class, such as pharmaceuticals, would have been a mere five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will the Pendulum Swing Back?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his blog the D&amp;amp;O Diary, Kevin LaCroix recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dandodiary.com/2020/09/articles/director-and-officer-liability/what-to-watch-in-the-world-of-do-3/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; a few court decisions, both in Delaware and California, which indicate that companies may be able to blunt &lt;em&gt;Cyan’s&lt;/em&gt; impact by adopting charter provisions that designate federal courts as the proper forums for their cases. These charter provisions could potentially protect companies from having to defend themselves in state courts where there are fewer procedural protections. It is too early to tell how of much of an impact these decisions will have on litigation trends.&lt;/p&gt;

Two members of our team, Joseph Burke PhD and Joseph Yarbrough, PhD, have analyzed our data to delve deeper into the risk that companies face from securities class action lawsuits and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3562785&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their findings on Google Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different facets to their research (last week we posted about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/six-leading-indicators-of-securities-litigation/&quot;&gt;six leading indicators of litigation&lt;/a&gt;), their analysis includes a comparison the relative exposure to security class action suits for public companies by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we are updating that research to include results from 2019, when 8.2% of companies traded on the Nasdaq or NYSE were defendants in a securities class action suit. Industry classifications are based on NAICS codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Manufacturing Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This segment is composed of companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-complaint-alleges-fundamental-corporate-governance-problems-accounting-shenanigans-and-insider-trading/&quot;&gt;Kraft Heinz&lt;/a&gt;, Pfizer and Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies classified as manufacturing companies made up the largest segment of all public companies traded on the Nasdaq and NYSE in 2019 at 38%. Manufacturing companies also had a 9% chance of being named a defendant in a securities class action suit in 2019, &lt;strong&gt;10% more likely than the average company&lt;/strong&gt;. About 40% of the defendants in this category were pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Construction Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the smaller segments, with only 70 companies in 2019, they comprise about 1% of the market. In 2019, construction companies had a 10% chance of being named a defendant in 2019, about &lt;strong&gt;22% more likely than the average company&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Information Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like Netflix, AT&amp;amp;T, and Slack Technologies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information companies had a 10.3% chance of being the defendant in a securities class action for 2019. That means if you had a client in the information industry, they were &lt;strong&gt;25% more likely than the average company&lt;/strong&gt; to be named as a defendant in a class action securities litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Education and Healthcare Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relatively small industry only accounts for 2% of all public companies traded on the Nasdaq and NYSE, but 10.9% of them were named as defendants in securities class action lawsuits in 2019. Education and Healthcare companies were &lt;strong&gt;33% more likely to be named as a defendant&lt;/strong&gt; than the average company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Retail Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category is comprised of companies like Wayfair, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, and Sotheby’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies classified as retail comprise 4% of the market and are the most likely to be named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit at 13.9%. Retail companies are &lt;strong&gt;69% more likely than the average company&lt;/strong&gt; to be subject to a securities class action lawsuit, making retail the riskiest industry for securities class action litigation in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

Our reports include 29 different categories, and each one is assigned a green, yellow, or red flag. These flags have helped our D&amp;amp;O Subscribers assess and price risks into their premiums in a way that is easy to understand for their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Categorizing the data allows our team to see patterns in the data from the past that allow us to make reasonable predictions about the future. Two members of our team, Joseph Burke PhD and Joseph Yarbrough, PhD, analyzed our data to see which data points corresponded with an increased risk of securities litigation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3562785&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their findings on Google Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting facets to their paper, but one of the most interesting was identifying six flags that were leading indicators of securities litigation. These flags all corresponded with a statistically significant increased risk of litigation the year after they were assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Yellow Flag for Non-Audit Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a company reports on its audit fees, they will distinguish between audit fees and non-audit fees. Non-audit fees consist of fees paid for something other than the independent audit. High non-audit fees can potentially compromise the independence of the auditing firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a spike in non-audit fees could indicate that the company is experiencing some sort of problem that they are attempting to address internally with the help of their auditor. For example, Under Armour had a dramatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-i-troubling-spike-in-non-audit-fees-went-ignored/&quot;&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; in non-audit fees the year before they revealed they were under investigation by the SEC, resulting in a damaging lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Yellow Flag for Cybersecurity Breach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is an area of increasing concern to companies. A significant breach can lead to immediate negative effects on stock price, loss of goodwill, customer complaints, and lawsuits. But the problems are not merely immediate, they can create long lasting problems and create an elevated risk of a damaging lawsuit for a least a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Yellow Flag for a Beneish M-Score&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beneish M-Score is a statistical model that uses financial ratios of certain accounting data to determine the probability that a company is manipulating its financial results. The model became known when some students at Cornell used it to assert that Enron was manipulating its results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tools online that will allow anyone to measure a company’s Beneish M-Score for themselves, we also provide one in every Watchdog Report (if there is adequate information for the analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Red Flag for CFO Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO changes are common and can be a sign of a healthy corporate culture. But rapid changes are a cause for concern, especially when the reason for the departure is vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again Under Armour is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-iii-major-cfo-change-a-warning-sign-of-litigation/&quot;&gt;emblematic&lt;/a&gt;; within a year of being appointed CFO, the new hire resigned for “personal reasons.” The next year, Under Armour was embroiled in litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Red Flag for Securities Class Action Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an event happens once, it is more likely to happen again. Our research indicates a securities class action suit more than doubles a company’s chance of having a securities lawsuit the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is no surprise to those familiar with insurance, but what may be surprising is that there is another flag which has a stronger predictive factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Red Flag for Revisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over twenty percent of companies that filed a revision were subject to a new lawsuit the &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; year. One would expect that a lawsuit would follow quickly on the heels of a restatement, but our research shows that a restatement is often only the beginning of a company’s legal woes.&lt;/p&gt;

Our products help capture and assess risk. The collapse of Luckin Coffee was a powerful reminder of how risky an investment in a Chinese company can be, however, at the time our analysis did &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/is-it-safer-to-invest-in-china-or-the-u-dot-s/&quot;&gt;not capture&lt;/a&gt; the risk posed by Luckin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis was lacking because the data was lacking. Foreign companies don’t have to meet the same rigorous disclosure requirements as U.S. companies, and that problem is exasperated among Chinese companies, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/emerging-market-investments-disclosure-reporting&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the SEC and PCAOB. Our reports now include a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/featuring-a-new-sec-oversight-flag-in-our-watchdog-reports/&quot;&gt;flag &lt;/a&gt;that warns investors when a company hails from a jurisdiction without much real regulatory oversight, but we are looking to take that analysis one step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are attempting to quantify the risk associated with investing in Chinese companies by quantifying the risk represented by the absence of data. It’s tricky stuff, but our PhDs are working on it. This project has generated all sorts of interesting data, and we thought we would share a snippet of that research with you here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Chinese%20listed%20and%20delisted%20graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese listed and delisted graph.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the total number of Chinese companies listed on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges every year, along with the number of Chinese companies that were delisted. On average, &lt;strong&gt;over 10%&lt;/strong&gt; of the exchange traded Chinese companies were delisted in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Chinese%20delisted%20percentage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese delisted percentage.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph shows that delistings have not been steady or consistent. In 2012 the Chinese reverse merger scams were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-china-fraud-boom-nasdaq-steps-up-scrutiny-of-shady-listings-2016-06-20#:\~:text=The%20Chinese%20reverse%20merger%20fraud,violations%20of%20U.S.%20securities%20laws.&quot;&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt;, and Western investors soured on Chinese companies. The bad press corresponded with a temporary wave in delistings, and a concurrent fall in overall listings. That wave of delistings started to recede in 2017. It will be interesting to see if Luckin’s collapse generates a new wave of delistings, or if  investments in China will go on undeterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally a delisting can benefit investors, if it occurs because a company is purchased or absorbed in a merger, but in most cases a delisting means a near total loss for shareholders. Low selling prices are a common reason for delisting, which signify an almost complete lack of investor demand or interest, even at bargain prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, the hunger for investments in China has apparently become insatiable, at least amongst a certain class. This has fueled many hyped Chinese IPOs, including Luckin’s IPO. It will be interesting to see if the combined effect of Luckin’s fraud, and a political clash between the U.S. and the CCP over the CCP’s longstanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-clash-over-pcaob/&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to allow the PCAOB to conduct inspect Chinese auditors will dampen investor enthusiasm for Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;
