Even before Elon Musk’s disastrous [April Fool’s joke](https://futurism.com/elon-musks-april-fools-prank-backfired/), TSLA closed at $257.78 on March 28th, finishing off a disastrous losing streak in which the stock lost almost exactly $100 per share in the course of one month. (It had previously closed at $357.42 on Feb. 26.)

Institutional confidence in TSLA seems to be held steady through the end of 2017, although there some concerns that it may be wavering. Institutional ownership increased by 2.8 million shares in 2017 Q4 98.3 million (+2.9%) while the largest institutional owners--Fidelity and Baillie Gifford & Co.--reduced their holdings by $8.5 billion. However, they continue to remain the largest institutional investors with nearly 30 million shares between them.

Institutional ownership data for 2018 Q1 will soon be available, giving us a better picture of this situation. However, if there has been an erosion in confidence among institutional investors, then it would explain the general weakening of prices in recent months. After recovering somewhat from a downturn last November, prices have been considerably lower on average in the three-month period from December through February as compared to the three-months from last August to October. And March, like November, seems to have brought a kind of reckoning.

A review of Tesla’s Corporate Watchdog Report reveals an unusual red flag regarding management turnover, specifically in the CFO position. Most of their other flags are back in 2013, a tumultuous year in which Tesla had a late filing, a financial restatement, and reported material weakness in their disclosure controls in three quarterly reports. However, the red flag for CFO turnover is very recent and highly unusual.

Here is the management turnover from Tesla’s Corporate Watchdog Report:

Corporate Watchdog Report reviews each change in the CEO and CFO position and grades it with either a yellow warning sign or a red flag. Changes in these positions will always receive a red flag if the change in position is due to certain reasons, such as disagreement with management or policies, an executive dismissed for cause, or for determined or suspected wrongdoing. Alternatively, a red flag will be assigned if there have been two or more changes in these positions within a three-year window, such as the case here. In this case, there were two changes in CFO within just 18 months.

The Corporate Watchdog Report also helpfully reminds us why these two positions are so sensitive: “These two officers are responsible for a company's performance and financial reporting.”

But Tesla’s case is unusual. Not only were there two changes CFO within a year and a half, but the former CFO returned to his former position.

**How unusual is it for the same person to be appointed CFO in the same company after a departure?**

To answer this question, first we asked how often the same person was appointed to the CFO position in the same company. Starting with a population of 12,894 filings with the SEC (mostly 8-K or 8-K/A’s) from 2013 to 2018, we identified 56 instances in which the same person was appointed to the CFO position in the same company. (We also excluded cases where two filings were within 90 days of each other, as these typically indicate a revision of the appointment date.)

Here is a table with the results of our analysis.

Reason	| Filings
--- | :---:
Interim	| 37
Merger / Acquisition | 5
Assuming Additional Position(s) | 4
Position Change within Company | 3
Changed Date of Appointment | 3
Change in Title | 2
Change in Control | 1
Corporate Restructuring | 1
Total | 56
Population | 12,894

When the same person was appointed CFO in the same company occur, it is almost always because an Interim CFO is being retained as the permanent CFO. Other filings can be explained as changes in responsibility or corporate restructurings. Notably, there is no filing that matches the Tesla case.

Second, we asked how often the same person was appointed to the CFO position in the same company after departing. Starting with the same population, we looked for appointments following departures.

Reason | Filings
--- | :---:
Resigned (Unclear if remained in company)  | 34
Resigned (Remained in Company) | 32
Position Change within Company | 17
Personal / Health Reasons | 10
Merger / Acquisition | 7
Retired | 5
Returning to Prior Position | 5
Other Opportunity | 4
Personal Leave | 3
Change in Control | 2
Employment Ceased | 2
Other | 1
Pursue Other Interests | 1
Dismissed | 1
Total | 124
Population | 12,894

“Resigned” is the most common reason given for departure, accounting for about half of the cases (66 out of 124). However, “resigned” here only means that the person resigned from the CFO position, not necessarily that they left the company (as with Tesla). In 32 of the 66 cases, based on the appointment data, we were able to determine that the resigning CFO remained with the company. For the other 32, it is unclear whether the resigning CFO left the company or not.

In Tesla’s case, Deepak Ahuja actually left the company when Jason Wheeler was CFO, not “resigning” but “retiring.” In interim, he served as a board director for FireEye, Inc. before returning to Tesla in March of 2017. Only four other CFOs have returned to position after retirement:
* On March 2, 2015, Mr. Donald A. Bittar came out of his retirement that began on November 3, 2014 to serve as Interim CFO for First Choice Healthcare Solutions, Inc.
* On August 7, 2015, Mr. Andrew Ashworth came out of his retirement that began on December 31, 2014 to serve as Interim CFO for BioAmber Inc.
* On January 1, 2016, Mr. Alan Miller returned to serve as Interim CFO for Frequency Electronics, Inc. However, his retirement has just become effective on the previous day, December 31, 2015, so he hadn’t really left, and agreed to remain as Interim CFO until the company completed its search.
* On December 17, 2017, Mr. John J. Fawcett came out of his retirement that began on April 6, 2015 to serve as Interim CFO for Citizen’s Financial Group.

In all cases, the only explanation for a CFO to return to position after retirement is to serve as an Interim CFO until a suitable replacement is found.

Except for Tesla.

Tesla is the only case in which, after a suitable replacement had been found, then left, and the former CFO returned to his former position, not as Interim, but as the permanent executive going forward.

Tesla’s red flag in management turnover is truly rare, which is why we’ve dubbed it a “black swan” red flag.

The turnover in the CFO position at Tesla is highly unusual and very troubling red flag. Tesla’s current market cap is about $50 billion dollars. That is a lot of retirement accounts and college savings to be responsible for. Fiduciaries should take care to inform investors of the risks associated with Tesla, and there are legitimate concerns whether Telsa is a suitable investment for many investors risk tolerance.

Fiduciaries and brokers who subscribe to the Corporate Watchdog Report may distribute the Corporate Watchdog Report among their current and prospective clients.
