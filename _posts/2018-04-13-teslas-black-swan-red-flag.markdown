Even before Elon Musk’s disastrous [April Fool’s joke](https://futurism.com/elon-musks-april-fools-prank-backfired/), TSLA closed at $257.78 on March 28th, finishing off a disastrous losing streak in which the stock lost almost exactly $100 per share in the course of one month. (It had previously closed at $357.42 on Feb. 26.)

Institutional confidence in TSLA seems to be held steady through the end of 2017, although there some concerns that it may be wavering. Institutional ownership increased by 2.8 million shares in 2017 Q4 98.3 million (+2.9%) while the largest institutional owners--Fidelity and Baillie Gifford & Co.--reduced their holdings by $8.5 billion. However, they continue to remain the largest institutional investors with nearly 30 million shares between them.

Institutional ownership data for 2018 Q1 will soon be available, giving us a better picture of this situation. However, if there has been an erosion in confidence among institutional investors, then it would explain the general weakening of prices in recent months. After recovering somewhat from a downturn last November, prices have been considerably lower on average in the three-month period from December through February as compared to the three-months from last August to October. And March, like November, seems to have brought a kind of reckoning.
A review of Tesla’s Corporate Watchdog Report reveals an unusual red flag regarding management turnover, specifically in the CFO position. Most of their other flags are back in 2013, a tumultous year in which Tesla had a late filing, a financial restatement, and reported material weakness in their disclosure controls in three quarterly reports. However, the red flag for CFO turnover is very recent and highly unusual.
