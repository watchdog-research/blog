*In 2020 CFO turnover fell from historic levels, yet CFO turnover maintains its long-term upward trend.*

The CFO position may be one of the most important positions at any public company. Financial problems at a public company tend to fall in the lap of the CFO first. If the CFO departs under troubling circumstances, that can be a signal of trouble down the road.

Under Armour soon disclosed significant accounting-related problems, problems that have resulted in an SEC investigation and a Wells Notice.
