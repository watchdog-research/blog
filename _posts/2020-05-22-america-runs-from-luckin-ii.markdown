*This post is the second part in a three-part series on Luckin Coffee. The post below was completed this on May 6th, 2020, while the story was still developing. Since we wrote this piece, Luckin has changed its story and [admitted](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm) that its CEO was involved in the massive fraud and [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm) releasing its annual report. It has also been [delisted](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm) from the Nasdaq, spelling death for the company. It has also spurred action in Washington, with the Senate [passing](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/senate-could-vote-on-bill-that-could-delist-chinese-companies-from-us-stock-exchanges-2020-05-19) a bill that could potentially delist every Chinese company unless the Chinese Communist Party releases its iron grip on information and allows the PCAOB to inspect its audit firms.*

*The Senate bill, if signed into law, would be a serious escalation in the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party. This is a ten page report detailing many of the vulnerabilities of the U.S. systems to Chinese fraud.  We touch on the inability of the PCAOB to inspect audit firms, which is the subject of the Senate bill, but we cover many other topics as well.

# **PART II: IMPOTENCE**

There is evidence to suggest Luckin Coffee’s executives—aided and abetted by segments of the CCP— schemed to steal billions from Western investors in one of the largest security fraud cases this decade. Corporate fraud may be a systemic problem in China, but the Western institutions that are supposed to act as gatekeepers to our capital markets appear to have been powerless before the CCP. It is remarkable that the NASDAQ; Luckin’s auditors, Ernst & Young; Credit Suisse and other securities underwriters; the SEC; the PCAOB; and the DOJ were all impotent to stop the fraud at Luckin.

Ultimately, however, it is Congress and the Executive branch that have left American investors vulnerable to fraud sanctioned by the CCP, by neutering all of the normal gatekeepers and watchdogs. *This must change.*

## *The Appeal of Growth in the Far East*

Around the time of the California gold-rush, Horace Greeley told Americans to go West, and many did, looking for quick and easy money. Some struck it rich, but many lost everything. Today, American investment houses, tired of stagnant growth in the United States, are rushing to [pour ](https://www.ft.com/content/cabf76d4-c5a1-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9)billions into Chinese companies, trying to tap into a growing market of 1.3 billion people. Investors are looking to strike it rich by throwing millions of dollars at the next Alibaba. But, all too often, promising companies have [turned out ](http://bassiounigroup.com/reverse-takeover-how-fraudulent-chinese-companies-are-deceiving-u-s-investors/)to be wholesale frauds.

The allure of rapid growth is irresistible to many investors. When Luckin marketed itself as the “Chinese Starbucks,” Western investors fell in love with the idea and heaped over [$1.5 billion ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-investigation-timeline/luckin-coffees-journey-from-hot-startup-to-5billion-share-wipeout-idUSKBN21L1HW)into Luckin through their public offerings. The stock price rose as high as $50 a share, fueled mostly by hype and enthusiasm, to $12 billion in market capitalization by mid-January 2020.

As China began to suffer from an outbreak of the coronavirus, many investors saw a concurrent stock decline as a great opportunity [to](https://investorplace.com/2020/04/luckin-coffee-lk-stock-will-be-a-post-coronavirus-buy/) buy. Even when short seller Muddy Waters took a position on Luckin[, and](https://www.barrons.com/articles/luckin-coffee-stock-muddy-waters-citron-research-short-sellers-fraud-claim-51580495986) revealed on January 31st that it had received an anonymous report accusing the company of fraud, investors [were](https://investorplace.com/2020/04/luckin-coffee-lk-stock-will-be-a-post-coronavirus-buy/) still high on Luckin. Its stock price remained resilient[—until](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920042189/a20-14831_1ex99d1.htm) Luckin disclosed its massive fraud on April 2nd.

In our first piece, we argued that the official story on Luckin’s fraud—that the COO and a few other employees were responsible—was extremely difficult to believe. It seems far more probable that the chairman Charles Lu and his associates arranged a massive fraud, the full scope of which we cannot be sure of yet. One must also suspect that elements of the CCP assisted Luckin and the fraud every step of the way, and that they are now helping to cover up and understate the fraud.

There has been some pushback. Given China’s history of reverse merger scams[, the](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-china-fraud-boom-nasdaq-steps-up-scrutiny-of-shady-listings-2016-06-20) recent reports of fraud at Luckin and TAL Education, and stories that the CCP has been lying extensively about the [coronavirus,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says) have led many Western investors to dump Chinese stock. The implications of this moment for Chinese companies and the overall market are hard to overstate. The CCP is apparently so alarmed about the potential implications, that it took the extremely unusual step of making an overture to the SEC and the PCAOB [in the](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/business/luckin-coffee-china-fraud-wall-street.html) wake of Luckin’s collapse.

The CCP has reason to worry. Chinese companies on the U.S. exchanges have already lost over $200 billion due to market downturn and investor concerns. And there is plenty of money still at stake here: our analysts have found that, even with a $200 billion decline, the current value of Chinese companies on the U.S. exchanges is over a *trillion *dollars.

![Luckin market table.png](/uploads/Luckin%20market%20table.png)

Many institutions in the United States have a strong incentive to paper over fundamental problems in giving Chinese firms access to the U.S. capital markets. Companies want access to a [growing ](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021015/how-many-multinational-corporations-operate-china.asp)market. Investment houses are prospecting for higher growth and better margins. Underwriters collect their fees. The exchanges make money for every company listed, creating a powerful incentive to list Chinese firms, regardless of any chronic problems these Chinese firms may have. The NASDAQ alone makes $37,000–$155,000 per [listing](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/2018_All_Inclusive_Annual_Fee.pdf) annually from each of the approximately 145 Chinese-based firms that trade on its Global and Capital Markets.

## *China Inc, or China CCP?*

Has China become China Inc., the largest corporation in the world, with monopolistic subsidiaries covering every sector of China’s economy, reaching out to compete worldwide? Is China an ideologically-driven communist regime, in its own cold war with the West? For the past two decades, the CCP, and its allies here in the U.S., have told us that China is not ideological, and that it is worth investing and partnering with China. But the CCP’s cover-up of the coronavirus, and its stating outwardly that [the](https://apnews.com/bf685dcf52125be54e030834ab7062a8) virus could not spread person-to-person, while hoarding medical supplies and allowing citizens to flee to foreign countries, has upended this conventional wisdom on China.

Given the untrustworthiness and potential hostility of the CCP, it is incredible that U.S. exchanges, underwriters, lawmakers, and regulators would permit Chinese companies, under the influence of the CCP, to have access to our capital markets, while not meeting the same reporting and accountability standards demanded of American firms. Yet that is what is happening, and the fraud at Luckin is proof.

After the Enron scandal rocked the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("SOX") introduced tough standards and better oversight, intended to prevent large-scale corporate fraud. However, since that time, standards have consistently been relaxed, first in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and then by the JOBS Act in 2012. These measures have loosened certain standards for domestic and foreign firms. Additionally, institutions meant to provide oversight, like the SEC and PCAOB, wilted when they encountered stiff resistance from the CCP.

## *Congress Lowered Standards by Creating "Emerging Growth Companies" Status*

Congress wanted to increase economic growth by easing access to capital markets for companies that had been considered too small to take public. To foster this ease of access, they created a new category of company, called an Emerging Growth Company (EGC) in the [JOBS Act ](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3606/summary#libraryofcongress)of 2012. Generally, an EGC is one that has less than $1 billion in revenue and less than $700 million in equity. If a company remains under the revenue threshold, it can keep its EGC status [for](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/EGC) up to five years.

An EGC is required to provide only two years of audited statements, instead of three, and less extensive disclosure on executive compensation. It can also delay compliance with new accounting standards. But perhaps the biggest advantage of EGC status is an exemption from receiving a SOX 404(b) opinion, where the independent auditor attests that management’s “internal controls” over financial reporting are effective.

So-called [“internal](https://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655710.pdf) controls” are the public's first line of defense against fraud and human error. Management is supposed to install a system that aids employees in routinely recording the economic activity of the company. This recording must be accurate, comprehensible to others, and designed so that neither employees nor management can misuse company assets or manipulate results.

Management has an incentive to create effective internal controls for its employees, but not necessarily for management itself. The Enron scandal showed that management could easily succumb to a temptation to manipulate results for its own benefit. Hence, policymakers created the SOX 404(b) attestation requirement, so that independent auditors would look over the shoulders of management and help ensure that management’s internal controls were effective.

The cost for a "SOX 404(b)" opinion varies, but it can [exceed ](https://www.schgroup.com/resource/blog-post/sarbanes-oxley-404b-compliance-a-refresher-of-the-initial-questions-you-should-be-asking/)$2 million a year, especially at the early stages of implementation. The high cost is due to the independent auditor's testing and evaluating the internal controls on financial reporting throughout the year, a time-consuming and expensive process (although likely much lower in a labor market like China). This extensive year-round testing makes concealing a large-scale fraud far more difficult for management. It seems likely that Luckin’s auditor, Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP ("EYHM"), would have detected the inflated revenues and costs if it had been testing the internal controls throughout the year. However, Luckin was classified as an EGC, and, therefore, EYHM [did not](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000104746919003174/a2238747z424b4.htm) offer an opinion on internal controls and did not do the requisite testing:

> *The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.* As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.* Accordingly, we express no such opinion. *(emphasis added)

SOX was passed with the idea that it would cover every company. However, its implementation for small issuers (those with less than $75 million in market cap) was initially delayed, and then permanently shelved under the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. Yet does the SOX 404(b) attestation have any real impact on[ the quality of](https://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655710.pdf) internal controls? An investigation was done by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2012 to see whether the SOX 404(b) requirement had any effect on the quality of internal controls. The GAO studied restatement rates of companies that had met the SOX 404(b) requirement (either by law or voluntarily) as compared with those that did not. The results indicated that companies without the SOX 404(b) requirement had weaker controls and therefore filed more restatements.

![Luckin GAO chart.jpg](/uploads/Luckin%20GAO%20chart.jpg)

Not surprisingly, as the chart shows, SOX 404(b) attestation requirement improves the quality of the financial reporting at a company. The GAO report [concluded ](https://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655710.pdf)that the SOX 404(b) attestation was potentially "useful for investors in gauging the reliability of a company’s financial reporting.”

By permitting EGCs an exemption to the SOX 404(b) attestation, Congress may have unintentionally lowered the quality of internal controls, and Luckin would be just one particularly bad example. Consider it this way: if a company makes a big splash with an IPO, so that it is too big to be considered a “small” issuer (that is, with less than $75 million in market cap), then it probably needs *extra *scrutiny. A rapidly growing company, hungry for capital, probably needs *more *scrutiny, not less. Instead, EGCs get a pass.

We are troubled enough by the implications of EGC status in the West: but we are positively alarmed by the implications of EGC status in Chinese companies, where real enforcement is effectively impossible. Luckin was not alone in taking advantage of EGC status to forego a SOX 404(b) auditor attestation. Our analysts compared all Chinese companies trading on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and OTC exchanges:

![Luckin EGC table.png](/uploads/Luckin%20EGC%20table.png)

Our analysts found that 53% of listed Chinese companies listed on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and OTC exchanges were classified as EGCs. The collective market cap for these companies is over $65 billion. Although this represents a little less than 5% of the total value of all Chinese-based companies traded on the exchanges, it is still a significant sum.

Some people have been quick to blame the auditors Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP for not uncovering this fraud earlier. But can people really blame EYHM, when it was Congress which loosened the restrictions, so that EYHM would not vigorously test and evaluate the internal controls at Luckin? (The issues surrounding EY in this story are very complex: we will give them separate treatment in Part III of this series).

As for the NASDAQ , it should be concerned that other companies similar to Luckin may be trading on their exchanges, and it would be a good step for it to insist that all Chinese-based companies be required to meet the SOX 404(b) requirement before listing. If the NASDAQ is hesitant to make this change on its own, it should use its powerful lobby in Washington to push Congress into mandating it.

## ***Foreign Companies Like Luckin Have Lax Insider Trading Disclosure Requirements***

The SEC enforces its insider trading laws vigorously. Under the Trump Administration, they have [increasingly pursued ](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/u-s-agencies-step-up-insider-trading-enforcement-against-foreign.html)foreign actors, especially the Chinese, for suspected insider trading. The SEC considers its enforcement of the insider trading rules to be a crucial part of its [function](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm#P225_88637).

> \[P\]rohibitions against insider trading in our securities laws play an essential role in maintaining the fairness, health, and integrity of our markets. We have long recognized that the fundamental unfairness of insider trading harms not only individual investors but also the very foundations of our markets, by undermining investor confidence in the integrity of the markets.

Section 16 of the Exchange Act seeks to deter improper insider trading by requiring directors, officers, and shareholders who hold over 10% of a company’s shares to [disclose ](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/officersanddirectors)most transactions of their stock within two business days. However, foreign private issuers like Luckin are exempt. This is no secret, as Luckin even [warned](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000104746919003174/a2238747z424b4.htm) investors about it in its prospectus:

> Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including … the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time … As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.

Foreign private issues are only required to include their insider trading information in their annual reports—*once a year*—compared to *two business days *for U.S. companies. Has Charles Lu or any other insiders dumped their stock? We do not know, as Luckin has delayed releasing their annual report.

When [announcing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm)this delay in late April, they claimed it was due to the impact of the coronavirus: they made no mention of problems stemming from the massive fraud they disclosed less than a month earlier.

Public policymakers need to reconsider whether it makes sense to lower our disclosure requirements for insider trading, as a means of encouraging foreign companies to gain access our capital markets. The Trump administration’s focus on foreign insider trading provides some comfort. However, enforcement actions can be effective only if foreign investors keep assets within reach of the authorities. Policymakers therefore need to prevent foreign insider trading in the first place, by ending Section 16 exemption for foreign private issuers.

## ***How Responsible is the NASDAQ for Slack in its Rules?***

After Sarbanes-Oxley was passed, the SEC set forth certain minimum standards for listing and trading on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and OTC exchanges. These rules were formulated with input from the exchanges themselves, private companies, regulators, auditors, academics, and other stakeholders. Sometimes, Congress will weigh in as well and tweak the system to advance certain public policy goals, as they did with Dodd-Frank in 2010 and the JOBS act in 2012. The SEC assists in promulgating rules which form a minimum standard, or a floor. But he NASDAQ and the NYSE as private entities can impose higher standards, which accounts for slight [variations ](https://www.freewritings.law/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2019/02/NYSE-vs-Nasdaq-Listing-Standards.pdf)in the listing requirements.

The NASDAQ and the NYSE have some discretion, so they bear some responsibility if slack in their standards enables a fraud. Admittedly, Congress is the main entity that has occupied the field. Nonetheless, the exchanges have much power and influence, and they should be advocating for strong standards to protect investors.

## *Luckin Flouted Corporate Governance Requirements*

Sarbanes-Oxley introduced extensive corporate governance rules to check management’s impulses and protect from fraud. The NASDAQ cooperates with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA," another [quasi-private](http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com/NASDAQTools/PlatformViewer.asp?selectednode=chp%5F1%5F1%5F3%5F3%5F8%5F3&amp;manual=%2Fnasdaq%2Fmain%2Fnasdaq%2Dequityrules%2F) oversight entity) in implementing these rules. A key component of these reforms was to require the involvement of “independent directors” in public companies, that is, directors who lack personal or financial ties which management can leverage to make the director beholden to management. The law requires that these independent directors be put in important positions to act as watchdogs for the company.

Usually, to trade on the NASDAQ, the majority of directors on the board must be independent. Additionally, the company must have an audit committee of three members, all of whom must be independent, and one of whom must be financially sophisticated (that is, with a background in accounting or something similar).

Whenever there is large-scale fraud at a company, one can be certain that there are flaws in corporate governance. Generally, there are two types of problems: (1) rules which are insufficient, because they allow companies to skirt around the spirit of the law, while staying within the letter of it, and (2) companies that simply break the rules. Luckin had both problems.

Luckin did not have a majority of independent directors. In fact, of the eight members of the board, only two, Thomas P. Meier and Sean Shao, were held out as independent directors. The NASDAQ has allowed foreign companies an exemption if the majority independence rule contradict local law. It also permitted foreign companies to request an exemption, if the requirement was against the generally accepted business practice for that specific country. But because few foreign firms were able to gain an exemption under this standard, they petitioned for a change in the rule. Indeed, the rule was[ relaxed](https://www.clm.com/publication.cfm?ID=23) in 2005, so that, instead of needing to request an exemption, firms could just declare that they were taking one. The change towards relaxation was not made in the best interests of investors, but rather it was because foreign companies can have legal and language barriers that make performing due diligence difficult. Unsurprisingly, Luckin opted to diminish the role on its board for these watchdogs:

> The Listing Rules of the NASDAQ generally require that a majority of an issuer's board of directors must consist of independent directors. However, the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ permit foreign private issuers like us to follow "home country practice" in certain corporate governance matters. We rely on this "home country practice" exemption and do not have a majority of independent directors serving on our Board of Directors.

There is no such exemption for the Audit Committee, however, which raises an important question: how could the audit committee have missed this fraud? How could the audit committee have missed a fabrication of more than half of the annual revenue with substantial changes in costs and expenses? One contributing factor is that the rules allow companies to [phase-in ](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/goingpublic.pdf)independent members after an IPO. Only two of the three audit committee members were independent, and one member, Mr. Erhai Liu was the founder and manager of Joy Capital, a firm that was heavily invested in the company. In sum, Luckin gamed the rules, using the foreign exception to the majority independent director rule, and the phase-in period for the audit committee, to reduce the scope of these independent directors’ roles as watchdogs.

But possibly Luckin also broke the rules. The directors which it held out as "independent" were Thomas P. Meier, the former president and CEO of Frankee Coffee Systems, and Sean Shao. However, when Mr. Meier was still leading Frankee coffee systems, they and another manufacturer obtained a contract with Luckin, in 2018, [that was](https://alltechasia.com/luckin-coffees-blue-partner-alliance-fuels-its-bold-10000-shop-target/) reported to quintuple sales. It seems plausible that serving in that role ought to have disqualified Mr. Meier from qualifying as an independent director. After all, NASDAQ does not consider independent:

> (D) *a director who is*, or has a Family Member who is, a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or *an executive officer of, any organization to which the company made*, or from which the company received, *payments for property* or services *in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000* ($1 million if the listed company is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange), *whichever is more*…

Mr. Meier left his position at Frankee in March 2019 to join Luckin as an independent director. Given the large contract with Luckin, apparently he should have been disqualified under the NASDAQ rules, as he was an executive at Frankee Coffee Systems, which had a contract with Luckin, which likely exceeded both 5% of revenue and $200,000. About three weeks after Luckin disclosed its fraud on April 21st, Mr. Meier resigned as an “independent” director and member of the audit committee. There was no explanation for his departure.

The other independent director, Sean Shao, has extensive experience as an independent director. He worked at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd for almost a decade before taking up the role of independent director at many companies. One of his longest tenures was with Agria Corporation, from 2008-2017, where he was an independent director and chairman of the corporate governance committee. In 2018, Agria settled with the SEC for [fraud ](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-276)relating to its operations in China from 2010- 2013.

## *NASDAQ's Hollow Requirement for PCAOB Oversight of Accounting Firms*

The NASDAQ requires that all companies trading on its exchange be audited by firms that are registered with the PCAOB. This is meant to assure investors that the companies listed on the Nasdaq are receiving the highest quality audits, because the auditors are subject to oversight from the PCAOB. The PCAOB is a quasi-private organization that was created after the Enron scandal to conduct investigations of audits.

Luckin’s auditor, Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, has been registered [with](https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?FirmID=7F42AF1786DA878DD7EAC2AFA2A74C03) the PCAOB since 2004.  EYHM is the Chinese affiliate of Ernst & Young Global Limited, one the big four. Ernst & Young’s Chinese affiliate EYHM, by itself, may be one of the largest accounting firms in the world. If one looks only at EYHM’s Chinese-based clients that are public companies trading on U.S. exchanges, in 2018

EYHM collected over $57 million in fees, from companies valued at over $213 billion dollars. EYHM also audits the Chinese operations of many multinational companies, like Apple and Walmart, and they undoubtably have many private company clients and clients listed on foreign exchanges.

Having a firm of EYHM’s stature as its external auditor certainly boosted investor confidence in Luckin’s financial statements. The fact that EYHM was registered with the PCAOB probably also contributed to this confidence, which is why Chinese [companies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111973) often pay a premium for auditors that are registered with the PCAOB. However, EYHM has never been subject to an inspection by the PCAOB: indeed no other Chinese audit firm has been inspected either. The [CCP](https://pcaobus.org/International/Inspections/Pages/IssuerClientsWithoutAccess.aspx) simply does not permit the PCAOB to inspect its audit firms.

The purpose of the PCAOB is to provide oversight of the accounting profession, so that companies and their investors receive high quality audits. Its role is so important, that the NASDAQ *requires *every company that lists on its exchange to be registered with the PCAOB. The most important tools in the PCAOB’s toolbox are its ability to inspect audit firms and to deregister them if they fail to meet industry standards. But they simply do not have these tools when it comes to Chinese firms.

Why then are Chinese audit firms allowed to register with the PCAOB at all, if they are not subject to inspections? After all, isn’t that the point of the PCAOB? The PCAOB does not deregister them, because that would be enormously disruptive to business: Chinese-based audit firms provide services for Chinese-based companies worth over a trillion dollars, and they provide audit services for China based operations of multinational companies as well. The PCAOB cannot effectively delist hundreds of companies, collectively valued at over a trillion dollars, on its own. The public policy implications are so broad, that only Congress could make a decision like that. Unless Congress takes some action, then, the NASDAQ's insistence that all firms be registered with the PCAOB will remain a flaccid requirement.

One small step that the SEC and PCAOB have taken is to [require ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kingsoft-cloud-ipo/kingsoft-sets-terms-for-u-s-listing-first-major-ipo-since-coronavirus-crisis-idUSKBN22G2JB)companies in China to disclose, in all relevant financial statements, the fact that their auditors are not subject to inspections by the PCAOB . But is this enough? And why is this allowance given to Chinese-based but not US companies with major operations in China?

## *Have Underwriters Become Careless?*

Before a company offers its stock to the public in an IPO, it is supposed to undergo an extensive vetting process. Part of this process is called underwriting, and it involves having investment banks act as intermediaries between the company and the public. The investment bankers conduct a substantial factual investigation of the company and its prospectus so that it can accurately price the stock. Sometimes, the underwriters will purchase shares at a wholesale price and then resell them to other investors.

The [underwriters](https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3078667/credit-suisse-out-tencent-backed-wedoctors-hong-kong-ipo) for the Luckin IPO were Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, China International Capital corporation and Haitong. This consortium of influential investment banks certainly had the resources to conduct proper due diligence on Luckin, but did they? The IPO was on May 17th, 2019, and Luckin has now stated that its numbers were unreliable for the quarter starting on April 1, 2019.

Thus, even if one accepts the story (and we are skeptical) that the fraud at Luckin began in the second quarter of 2019, there is still overlap between the start of the fraud and the timeframe in which the banking consortium should have been conducting its due diligence. There have also been troubling allegations in an anonymous report published by Muddy Waters of related party transactions, and other red flags, which the banking consortium might have discovered in its due diligence process.

Is it possible that the banking consortium could have discovered the fraud with proper due diligence? The SEC has [declared](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-investigation/u-s-sec-investigates-luckin-coffee-over-accounting-scandal-wsj-idUSKBN22B1D6) an investigation into Luckin’s fraud, and they will likely take a look at the banking consortium’s due diligence practices. Luckin’s fraud has already resulted in lawsuits. Because Chinese law will probably shelter Luckin’s assets, it is likely that suits will also be filed against the underwriters.

***Effective Immunity from Private Suit***

A suit against the underwriters could be very difficult to win. In 1994 the Supreme Court held that private plaintiffs could not sue a third party for aiding or abetting a fraud, in Central Bank v. First Interstate, 511, U.S. 164 (1994). In 2008, the Supreme Court doubled down in Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, holding that third parties are not liable for participating in corporate wrongdoing if they did not directly mislead investors. In 2008, the Supreme Court had also denied certiorari in California Regents v. Merrill Lynch, a case in which the 5th Circuit found Merrill Lynch and other investment banks not liable for Enron's fraud, even though they had aided Enron in cooking their books, on the grounds that they did not have a duty to investors, and they had made no false statements directly to them.

These decisions in the Supreme Court have been reinforced by decisions in the lower courts, such as SEC v. Tambone, where the 1st Circuit held that the underwriters for an IPO do not make any implied representations in the prospectus, even though they have a duty to investigate a company. But it seems timely to ask: Has this protection from private suit made underwriters careless?

The 1933 Securities Act does allow underwriters to be sued in a private cause of action when there are false statements in the prospectus for an IPO under sections 11 and 12a-3 (unlike the provision 10b-5 that allows a private cause of action for fraud subject to the Central Bank and Stoneridge decisions discussed above). However, unlike a private suit brought under 10b-5, due diligence is a complete defense to this charge. If the consortium can show they took “[reasonable care](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.176)” and conducted a reasonable investigation of Luckin, then they will be immune from suit. It will be interesting to see if substance will triumph over style in the court’s analysis of the consortium’s due diligence. Since most of the events occurred in China, we will also be interested to see if any investigation is even feasible.

*The SEC as the Last Line of Defense*

One thing to note is that the SEC, for its part, *can *bring a 10b-5 case against an entity that aids and abets a fraud, because it is a government entity and not a private entity. The publicity surrounding this case, and the SEC investigation into Luckin, has actually raised the possibility that Credit Suisse and Morgan will be charged with aiding and abetting Luckin’s fraud. But, once again, a lack of information coming out of China may hamper any investigation.

# **Conclusion**

Foreign companies and domestic companies are both trying to gain access to the capital markets in the United States, but they do not have to play by the same rules. Foreign companies have numerous allowances designed to give leeway, and Luckin took advantage of them. Yet consider how enormous Luckin’s fraud was: it fabricated half of its revenue and potentially stole *billions *from Western investors. This will happen again, and happen soon, unless policymakers take decisive action.
