      <p>In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/">report</a> arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a>, the WSJ wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">exposé</a> detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">implicated</a> by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx">reportedly</a> facing charges.</p>

      <p>In February 2018, we published a <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/symantec-flashback-what-happened/">report</a> calling out the management of Symantec for a perceived lack of candor in the way they handled a whistleblower report of accounting irregularities and a subsequent SEC investigation. In particular, we honed-in on Symantec’s failure to disclose any material weakness in their internal controls and their dubious claim that a $12 million adjustment in revenue in 2018 was immaterial.</p>

      <p>In our previous piece “<a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/birds-of-a-feather-how-to-tell-a-gray-swan-from-a-black-swan-dot/">Birds of a Feather: How to Tell a Gray Swan from a Black Swan</a>,” we discussed how difficult it may be to spot when a company disingenuously blames an impairment of goodwill on the effects of the coronavirus, as opposed to righfuly blaming it on preexisting conditions at the company. We then <em>specifically</em> mentioned Under Armour’s (UA) Latin American reporting unit as one to watch because PwC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691720000010/ua-20191231.htm">highlighted</a> the goodwill impairment testing of that specific reporting unit as requiring particularly “<em>challenging, subjective, or complex judgements</em>” in its Critical Audit Matters (CAMs).</p>

      <p>Kraft Heinz (KHC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745919000020/february2019form8-k.htm">announced</a> a massive $15.4 billion impairment in February, 2019 to its goodwill and intangible assets.  This impairment was essentially an admission by management major components of the combined company were worth billions less than recorded on the balance sheet.  It was also an admission that 3G Capital (3G) and Warren Buffett’s much touted merger of Kraft and Heinz was a failure.   In the aftermath, Warren Buffett <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buffett-criticizes-others-for-using-non-standard-accounting-metricsbut-he-does-too-2019-02-26">admitted </a>that he had overpaid for his 27% of combined company.</p>

<p>KHC’s impairment crushed share prices and has led to lawsuits, rapid executive bloodletting, an SEC investigation, and other deleterious events.  We <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/">wrote</a> about the KHC bus-crash last September and argued that KHC’s core problem was a loss of investor trust and a poor management ethos.</p>

      <p><em>Joseph Burke PhD. and Joseph Yarbrough PhD, have produced two white papers for Watchdog Research that show that companies with higher Gray Swan Event Factors have a lower return on investment.

      <p>We originally wrote this post on Luckin Coffee over a month ago on April 27th, 2020.  Since then the story has significantly developed. Since we wrote this piece, Luckin has changed its story and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">admitted</a> that its CEO was involved in the massive fraud and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm">delayed</a> releasing its annual report.  The WSJ has also written a devastating <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">piece</a> that confirmed our suspicions that many of the expenses were fabricated and that Charles Lu, the chairman, sat at the center of a complicated web of related party transactions that began before the IPO. Luckin has also been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a> from the Nasdaq, hopefully for good.</p>

      <p>In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/">report</a> arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a>, the WSJ wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">exposé</a> detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">implicated</a> by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx">reportedly</a> facing charges.</p>

      <p>In February 2018, we published a <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/symantec-flashback-what-happened/">report</a> calling out the management of Symantec for a perceived lack of candor in the way they handled a whistleblower report of accounting irregularities and a subsequent SEC investigation. In particular, we honed-in on Symantec’s failure to disclose any material weakness in their internal controls and their dubious claim that a $12 million adjustment in revenue in 2018 was immaterial.</p>

We then <em>specifically</em> mentioned Under Armour’s (UA) Latin American reporting unit as one to watch because PwC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691720000010/ua-20191231.htm">highlighted</a> the goodwill impairment testing of that specific reporting unit as requiring particularly “<em>challenging, subjective, or complex judgements</em>” in its Critical Audit Matters (CAMs).</p>

      <p>Kraft Heinz (KHC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745919000020/february2019form8-k.htm">announced</a> a massive $15.4 billion impairment in February, 2019 to its goodwill and intangible assets.  This impairment was essentially an admission by management major components of the combined company were worth billions less than recorded on the balance sheet.  It was also an admission that 3G Capital (3G) and Warren Buffett’s much touted merger of Kraft and Heinz was a failure.   In the aftermath, Warren Buffett <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buffett-criticizes-others-for-using-non-standard-accounting-metricsbut-he-does-too-2019-02-26">admitted </a>that he had overpaid for his 27% of combined company.</p>

<p>KHC’s impairment crushed share prices and has led to lawsuits, rapid executive bloodletting, an SEC investigation, and other deleterious events.  We <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/">wrote</a> about the KHC bus-crash last September and argued that KHC’s core problem was a loss of investor trust and a poor management ethos.</p>

      <p>We originally wrote this post on Luckin Coffee over a month ago on April 27th, 2020.  Since then the story has significantly developed. Since we wrote this piece, Luckin has changed its story and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">admitted</a> that its CEO was involved in the massive fraud and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm">delayed</a> releasing its annual report.  The WSJ has also written a devastating <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">piece</a> that confirmed our suspicions that many of the expenses were fabricated and that Charles Lu, the chairman, sat at the center of a complicated web of related party transactions that began before the IPO. Luckin has also been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a> from the Nasdaq, hopefully for good.</p>

      <p>In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/">report</a> arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a>, the WSJ wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">exposé</a> detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">implicated</a> by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx">reportedly</a> facing charges.</p>

      <p>In February 2018, we published a <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/symantec-flashback-what-happened/">report</a> calling out the management of Symantec for a perceived lack of candor in the way they handled a whistleblower report of accounting irregularities and a subsequent SEC investigation. In particular, we honed-in on Symantec’s failure to disclose any material weakness in their internal controls and their dubious claim that a $12 million adjustment in revenue in 2018 was immaterial.</p>

We then <em>specifically</em> mentioned Under Armour’s (UA) Latin American reporting unit as one to watch because PwC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691720000010/ua-20191231.htm">highlighted</a> the goodwill impairment testing of that specific reporting unit as requiring particularly “<em>challenging, subjective, or complex judgements</em>” in its Critical Audit Matters (CAMs).</p>

      <p>Kraft Heinz (KHC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745919000020/february2019form8-k.htm">announced</a> a massive $15.4 billion impairment in February, 2019 to its goodwill and intangible assets.  This impairment was essentially an admission by management major components of the combined company were worth billions less than recorded on the balance sheet.  It was also an admission that 3G Capital (3G) and Warren Buffett’s much touted merger of Kraft and Heinz was a failure.   In the aftermath, Warren Buffett <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buffett-criticizes-others-for-using-non-standard-accounting-metricsbut-he-does-too-2019-02-26">admitted </a>that he had overpaid for his 27% of combined company.</p>

<p>KHC’s impairment crushed share prices and has led to lawsuits, rapid executive bloodletting, an SEC investigation, and other deleterious events.  We <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/">wrote</a> about the KHC bus-crash last September and argued that KHC’s core problem was a loss of investor trust and a poor management ethos.</p>

      <p>We originally wrote this post on Luckin Coffee over a month ago on April 27th, 2020.  Since then the story has significantly developed. Since we wrote this piece, Luckin has changed its story and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">admitted</a> that its CEO was involved in the massive fraud and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm">delayed</a> releasing its annual report.  The WSJ has also written a devastating <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">piece</a> that confirmed our suspicions that many of the expenses were fabricated and that Charles Lu, the chairman, sat at the center of a complicated web of related party transactions that began before the IPO. Luckin has also been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a> from the Nasdaq, hopefully for good.</p>

      <p>In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/">report</a> arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a>, the WSJ wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">exposé</a> detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">implicated</a> by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx">reportedly</a> facing charges.</p>

      <p>In February 2018, we published a <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/symantec-flashback-what-happened/">report</a> calling out the management of Symantec for a perceived lack of candor in the way they handled a whistleblower report of accounting irregularities and a subsequent SEC investigation. In particular, we honed-in on Symantec’s failure to disclose any material weakness in their internal controls and their dubious claim that a $12 million adjustment in revenue in 2018 was immaterial.</p>

We then <em>specifically</em> mentioned Under Armour’s (UA) Latin American reporting unit as one to watch because PwC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691720000010/ua-20191231.htm">highlighted</a> the goodwill impairment testing of that specific reporting unit as requiring particularly “<em>challenging, subjective, or complex judgements</em>” in its Critical Audit Matters (CAMs).</p>

      <p>Kraft Heinz (KHC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745919000020/february2019form8-k.htm">announced</a> a massive $15.4 billion impairment in February, 2019 to its goodwill and intangible assets.  This impairment was essentially an admission by management major components of the combined company were worth billions less than recorded on the balance sheet.  It was also an admission that 3G Capital (3G) and Warren Buffett’s much touted merger of Kraft and Heinz was a failure.   In the aftermath, Warren Buffett <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/buffett-criticizes-others-for-using-non-standard-accounting-metricsbut-he-does-too-2019-02-26">admitted </a>that he had overpaid for his 27% of combined company.</p>

<p>KHC’s impairment crushed share prices and has led to lawsuits, rapid executive bloodletting, an SEC investigation, and other deleterious events.  We <a href="https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/kraft-heinz-warren-buffets-dunkirk/">wrote</a> about the KHC bus-crash last September and argued that KHC’s core problem was a loss of investor trust and a poor management ethos.</p>

      <p>We originally wrote this post on Luckin Coffee over a month ago on April 27th, 2020.  Since then the story has significantly developed. Since we wrote this piece, Luckin has changed its story and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm">admitted</a> that its CEO was involved in the massive fraud and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920052907/a20-18059_16k.htm">delayed</a> releasing its annual report.  The WSJ has also written a devastating <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336">piece</a> that confirmed our suspicions that many of the expenses were fabricated and that Charles Lu, the chairman, sat at the center of a complicated web of related party transactions that began before the IPO. Luckin has also been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm">delisted</a> from the Nasdaq, hopefully for good.</p>
