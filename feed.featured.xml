            <title>SEC Comment Letters and Accounting Problems Plague Contura Energy, Inc. “CTRA”</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>SEC Comment Letters</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;CTRA is a company that mines and processes coal before selling it to powerplants and steel producers. 2020 has brought some unexpected challenges for all energy producing companies, as demand has fallen sharply. According to the U.S. Energy Information Association, demand for coal is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/coal.php#:\~:text=EIA%20forecasts%20that%20U.S.%20coal%20exports%20will%20decrease,by%2032%25%20to%2063%20MMst.&amp;amp;text=Based%20on%20an%20assumed%20increase,for%20U.S.%20coal%20in%20India.&quot;&gt;down 37%&lt;/a&gt; from last year. But CTRA is not merely struggling with the fallout of the pandemic, there recent disclosures have raised a bevy of red flags related to their accounting and internal controls.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When CRON &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1656472/000165647220000030/q3exhibit991fs.htm&quot;&gt;restated&lt;/a&gt; the third quarter results for 2019, it attributed the restatement to “accounting errors.” Accounting errors?
