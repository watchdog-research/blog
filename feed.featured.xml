            <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in Cyan Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Retirement Fund (&lt;em&gt;“Cyan”&lt;/em&gt;). This decision allowed plaintiffs to bring cases in some state courts which previously had only been triable in federal court. &lt;em&gt;Cyan&lt;/em&gt; made it easier for plaintiffs to bring cases, and the predicable result has been an increase in cases.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;57% of Chinese delistings are associated with fraud, illegal activity, or highly suspicious circumstances, according to our research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Investors in Chinese companies are at a greater risk of a total loss from delisting than those investing in companies from any other country. This risk is especially high in the first few years after a Chinese company is listed on a U.S. Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Impact of Restatements: The Bigger They Are…</title><author>John Cheffers</author>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is nothing worse as an investor than when a company experiences a gray swan event like a financial restatement. Investors are rarely prepared for the bad news and have difficulty placing it into context; it is no wonder that for many investors the initial reaction to a financial restatement is a panicked sell-off.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Restatements Are Rare, But Can Pack a Punch</title><author>John Cheffers</author>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Public companies are required to keep investors and the public well informed concerning their financial condition. People rely on this information and expect it to be accurate. Accordingly, a company must file a restatement if it determines that its previous financial disclosures were inaccurate, and that people should not rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;
