            <description>&lt;p&gt;Before a company offers its stock to the public in an IPO, it is supposed to undergo an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/assets/330/321612.pdf&quot;&gt;extensive&lt;/a&gt; vetting process. Part of this process is called underwriting, and it involves having investment banks act as intermediaries between the company and the public. The investment bankers conduct a substantial factual investigation of the company and its prospectus so that it can accurately price the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might think that foreign companies would be held to the same standards as U.S. companies, but that is not true, not at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>America Runs From Luckin: Corporate Governance Failures</title><author>John Cheffers</author>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckin Coffee’s  massive fraud was discovered by its auditors, EY’s Chinese affiliate, Ernst &amp;amp; Young Hua Ming LLP. The affiliate  probably would have discovered the fraud earlier if not for Luckin’s status as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-fraud-enabled-by-slack-standards/&quot;&gt;Emerging Growth Company&lt;/a&gt;, but in this post we turn our attention to Luckin’s board of directors, who ought to serve as the first line of defense against fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>America Runs From Luckin: Fraud Enabled by Slack Standards</title><author>John Cheffers</author>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckin Coffee engaged in one of the most brazen frauds in history. It is easy to blame the fraud on the business environment in China fostered by the CCP. But this fraud could not have occurred if not for systemic weaknesses in the Western capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm&quot;&gt;delisted&lt;/a&gt;, the WSJ wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336&quot;&gt;exposé&lt;/a&gt; detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm&quot;&gt;implicated&lt;/a&gt; by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; facing charges.&lt;/p&gt;
