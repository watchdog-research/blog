            <description>&lt;p&gt;Public companies are required to keep investors and the public well informed concerning their financial condition. People rely on this information and expect it to be accurate. Accordingly, a company must file a restatement if it determines that its previous financial disclosures were inaccurate, and that people should not rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cybersecurity Litigation Review</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>Cybersecurity</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity has gone from a niche concern to a hot topic in the D&amp;amp;O insurance world. Tomorrow, on September 23rd, we will be attending (remotely of course)  a webinar hosted by PLUS on how companies can strategically handle cybersecurity concerns. We are an independent research provider that uses an extensive database of public information to create easy-to-use reports for over 4,500 publicly traded companies. Since we track cybersecurity incidents and all material litigation for public companies, we thought we could use this as an opportunity to provide a little color to the important discussions concerning cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
