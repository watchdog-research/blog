            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most ETFs arenâ€™t technically derivatives, but they may pose similar risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Online Brokers are ... Not Brokers?</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>Online Brokers</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, online brokers are operating in a gray space. They seem to want to replace traditional brokers, as evidenced by their marketing and the services they offer. Yet they do not want to take on the responsibility of making suitable recommendations for investors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Who is Auditing SPACs?</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>SPACs</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The number of SPACs exploded in 2020, exceeding the number of traditional IPOs for the first time ever. That growth looks like it will continue in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2021/will-spacs-be-back-with-a-bang-in-2021/&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;. SPACs have been around for a long time, however, they have only recently generated significant interest and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SPACs in the Cayman Islands</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>SPACs</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our research indicates that only &lt;strong&gt;3.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of all companies are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and that includes some companies that are actually located there. In contrast, &lt;strong&gt;28%&lt;/strong&gt; of all SPACs are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, despite the fact that &lt;strong&gt;88%&lt;/strong&gt; of them are located in the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <category>SPACs</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Long ago FINRA warned that SPAC managers were incentivized to overpay for companies. This year a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/71816/Updated-SPAC-returns-fall-short-of-traditional-IPO-returns-on-average#:\~:text=Of%20the%20313%20SPACs%20IPOs,for%20traditional%20IPOs%20since%202015.&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of SPACs showed that their average return was &lt;strong&gt;-9.6%&lt;/strong&gt;. Of all the SPACs studied, only &lt;strong&gt;31.1%&lt;/strong&gt; had positive returns.&lt;/p&gt;
