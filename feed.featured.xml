            <description>&lt;p&gt;With the coronavirus shutting down entire industries and raising the possibility of an extended recession, pending mergers are in peril, and mergers overall will become disfavored as companies lose their appetite for risk.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus has shocked and stress tested institutions all over the world.  The emergence of the pandemic, and the global panic it has caused, is a true black swan event.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Under Armour III: Major CFO Change Was a Warning Sign of Litigation</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>featured</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;CFOs play an outsized role in the financial health of a company.  When a CFO leaves abruptly or under bad circumstances, that event can have far reaching implications.  Lawrence “Chip” Molloy’s departure from Under Armour was as damaging as it was sudden and mysterious.  Within a year after being brought in from as an outsider, he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691717000008/january312017form8-k.htm&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; for “personal reasons.”  In his wake there was litigation, an SEC investigation only recently brought to light, and—of course—more litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Under Armour II: CAM Raises the Specter of “Channel Stuffing”</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>Red Flags</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/under-armour-i-troubling-spike-in-non-audit-fees-went-ignored/&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; piece on Under Armour (UA) we looked at how a dramatic increase in non-audit fees by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was a sign of financial problems and a leading indicator of litigation. We also briefly examined UA’s SEC investigation, which was first reported on by the Wall Street Journal.  This investigation has remained somewhat mysterious and UA has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/under-armour-says-its-accounting-practices-have-been-entirely-appropriate-after-wsj-story-2019-11-15&quot;&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; any wrongdoing.  Thanks to the newly required disclosures of Critical Audit Matters (CAMs), we are getting some clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Under Armour I: Troubling Spike in Non-Audit Fees Went Ignored</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>Leading Indicators</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Under Armour still has not recovered from a serious blow it suffered in early November 2019 when the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had been under investigation by the SEC for its accounting practices.  One element of the story that rattled investors was that the investigation had been going on since July &lt;em&gt;of 2017&lt;/em&gt;, yet it had not been addressed in a transparent way by management.&lt;/p&gt;
