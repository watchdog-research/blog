            <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckin Coffee engaged in one of the most brazen frauds in history. It is easy to blame the fraud on the business environment in China fostered by the CCP. But this fraud could not have occurred if not for systemic weaknesses in the Western capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>America Runs From Luckin: Clash Over the PCAOB</title><author>John Cheffers</author>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, just as the America was in the grip of the coronavirus originating from Wuhan, Luckin Coffee initially reported that it had discovered a fraud by the COO fabricating over half of the company’s revenue. We wrote an in-depth &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/america-runs-from-luckin-i/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; arguing the fraud was far more pervasive. Since then, Luckin has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920063497/a20-20057_1ex99d1.htm&quot;&gt;delisted&lt;/a&gt;, the WSJ wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-fall-of-chinas-luckin-coffee-a-network-of-fake-buyers-and-a-fictitious-employee-11590682336&quot;&gt;exposé&lt;/a&gt; detailing far more extensive fraud than originally reported, the CEO was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1767582/000110465920059927/a20-19256_1ex99d1.htm&quot;&gt;implicated&lt;/a&gt; by Luckin, and now Luckin’s chairman and founder is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/08/why-luckin-coffee-stock-dropped-today.aspx&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; facing charges.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Symantec Complaint Cites Watchdog Research’s Analysis</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>featured</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2018, we published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/symantec-flashback-what-happened/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; calling out the management of Symantec for a perceived lack of candor in the way they handled a whistleblower report of accounting irregularities and a subsequent SEC investigation. In particular, we honed-in on Symantec’s failure to disclose any material weakness in their internal controls and their dubious claim that a $12 million adjustment in revenue in 2018 was immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Symantec FLASHBACK “What happened?”</title>
            
            <category>Independent Research</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We originally published this report in February 1, 2019 to FactSet. We are now republishing it on our blog since it was referenced and quoted in a securities lawsuit against Symantec, which has since changed its name to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;amp;CIK=0000849399&amp;amp;owner=exclude&amp;amp;count=40&quot;&gt;NortonLifeLock Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Under Armor Goodwill Impairment Due to Coronavirus or Preexisting Conditions?</title><author>John Cheffers</author>
            
            <category>coronavirus</category>
            

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous piece “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.watchdogresearch.com/posts/birds-of-a-feather-how-to-tell-a-gray-swan-from-a-black-swan-dot/&quot;&gt;Birds of a Feather: How to Tell a Gray Swan from a Black Swan&lt;/a&gt;,” we discussed how difficult it may be to spot when a company disingenuously blames an impairment of goodwill on the effects of the coronavirus, as opposed to righfuly blaming it on preexisting conditions at the company. We then &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; mentioned Under Armour’s (UA) Latin American reporting unit as one to watch because PwC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691720000010/ua-20191231.htm&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; the goodwill impairment testing of that specific reporting unit as requiring particularly “&lt;em&gt;challenging, subjective, or complex judgements&lt;/em&gt;” in its Critical Audit Matters (CAMs).&lt;/p&gt;
